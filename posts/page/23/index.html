What I noticed was that my CPU usage went through the roof (constantly at 100%) even if the guest was completely idle. Result: My laptop was shutting down within a few minutes because the CPU was heating up and its temperature going beyond 75C. And finally came to know a simple solution from a friend, that immediately worked. The solution was to create a new dummy guest machine in VirtualBox, allocate minimal RAM to it (I gave 4MB) and just run it, don’t even need to add boot disk to it and to my surprise, the CPU usage came down to just 3-4% immediately. I’m not sure why this issue is happening and how the dummy machine solved it but atleast it is working for me now. If you have a similar issue, you can try out the same.</p></div><div><a class="read-more button inline" href=/2009/07/07/virtualbox-high-cpu-usage-problem-solved/></a></div></article><article class="post on-list"><h2 class=post-title><a href=https://shantanugoel.com/2009/07/03/compiling-latest-firefly-mt-daapd-asus-wl-500w/>Compiling Latest FireFly (mt-daapd) for ASUS WL-500W</a></h2><div class=post-meta><time class=post-date>2009-07-03</time><span class=post-author>Shantanu Goel</span></div><div class=post-content><p>FireFly is a nice DAAP based media server that allows you to listen to your music collection anywhere using any DAAP based client like iTunes, with other players (like Winamp, Rhythmbox, VLC, etc) using plugins, or it even has its own dedicated php/flash/java based clients that can be fired up on any platform any computer giving you instant nirvana.</p><p>Many people, like me, use it on their Routers or NAS boxes to access their music anywhere without having to keep their home PC running or lugging around external drives. However, development on this gem stopped some time ago. The last stable build released (2.4.2) was good but it doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of features provided by the nightly builds in svn (subversion). And the last nightly build released (svn-1696) had a lot of broken things. It was rebuilding the database everytime, crashed around quite a bit, had a lot of security holes. So, I decided to get the latest version (trunk) of the FireFly code, as it had a lot of fixes for above issues, put in whatever was missing, and try to build it for my use.</p></div><div><a class="read-more button inline" href=/2009/07/03/compiling-latest-firefly-mt-daapd-asus-wl-500w/></a></div></article><article class="post on-list"><h2 class=post-title><a href=https://shantanugoel.com/2009/06/17/opera-web-server-browser-bad-idea/>Opera Web Server In A Browser: Bad Idea</a></h2><div class=post-meta><time class=post-date>2009-06-17</time><span class=post-author>Shantanu Goel</span></div><div class=post-content><p>Today, the whole word is going gaga over &ldquo;<a href=http://unite.opera.com/>Opera Unite</a>&rdquo;, the new technology in Opera 10 which will make your web browser a web server as well (and not just that, it will make a whole lot of “sharing” options available). Well, I’m not so excited about it. Technology wise, it is really cool but what they don’t realize is that this is like giving motorized chain-saw or a swiss army knife in the hands of a two-year old. Seriously, majority of the people around the world who get themselves into all sorts of shit while just plain surfing the net, now got a whole new array of avenues where they can be exploited upon. For people who do need a webserver, there are plenty of straight-forward point and click options available. I hope they atleast have options to completely turn it off and even better, keep it turned off by default.</p></div><div><a class="read-more button inline" href=/2009/06/17/opera-web-server-browser-bad-idea/></a></div></article><article class="post on-list"><h2 class=post-title><a href=https://shantanugoel.com/2009/05/10/microtek-ups-problems-solution/>Microtek UPS Problems (And A Solution)</a></h2><div class=post-meta><time class=post-date>2009-05-10</time><span class=post-author>Shantanu Goel</span></div><div class=post-content><p>I got myself a <strong>Microtek 800VA UPS (MDP800+)</strong> a couple of weeks ago to save my PS3 from the frequent power outages that we are seeing in Hyderabad but the purpose was rather lost when I found that it worked fine only till the mains power was on. As soon as there was an outage, it couldn’t stop the PS3 from an abrupt shut down. I ran around the pathetic Microtek customer service for days and they finally sent an “engineer” down to my place (after a week) to diagnose the issue and he couldn’t say anything more than that the UPS is meant for a PC and nothing else. All logical discussions to tell him that PS3 is essentially a PC but in a different form were kind of like pouring water on a well-oiled rock and hoping it would stick.</p></div><div><a class="read-more button inline" href=/2009/05/10/microtek-ups-problems-solution/></a></div></article><article class="post on-list"><h2 class=post-title><a href=https://shantanugoel.com/2009/05/04/ubuntu-904-jaunty-jackalope-upgrade-graphics-problem/>Why You Should Not Upgrade to Ubuntu Jaunty Jackalope (9.04)</a></h2><div class=post-meta><time class=post-date>2009-05-04</time><span class=post-author>Shantanu Goel</span></div><div class=post-content><p><strong>Update: It has come to my notice that many people do not know about this (and other problems listed in comments of this post).
