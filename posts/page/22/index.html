Killzone 2 is a very different game as compared to the other run-of-the-mill FPS&rsquo;s out there. Now, I might not be the best player out there but I&rsquo;ve played my fair share of it. So, I thought of jotting down some quick points for the different classes, how to play them and how to make the most of them according to my opinion. I hope to make this a series where I would discuss the strategies for a class and its primary and secondary abilities and once all classes are covered, I&rsquo;ll probably touch upon the rest of the aspects of the game. Please read them and supplement them with real practice to see the benefits. And yeah, do not hesitate to point out the flaws if any and I&rsquo;d also love to hear about the tactics that you follow as well as KZ2 is a game where the element of surprise is very important which calls for unusual strategies many times ;).<br>So without wasting any more time, here is a really really basic set that you should follow:</p></div><div><a class="read-more button inline" href=/2009/08/09/killzone-2-tips-tricks-tactics-stategies-engineer/></a></div></article><article class="post on-list"><h2 class=post-title><a href=https://shantanugoel.com/2009/07/10/shutdown-asus-wl-500-w/>Easiest Way to Shutdown Asus WL-500W</a></h2><div class=post-meta><time class=post-date>2009-07-10</time><span class=post-author>Shantanu Goel</span></div><div class=post-content><p>If you are a proud owner of an Asus WL-500W wireless router (or maybe another one of the same series like wl-500g, wl-500gp, etc), then you know that this router has a very useful USB port with which you might have attached your external hard disk and have already offloaded all your downloding tasks to it, or maybe using it for various other purposes. Whatever maybe the reason, the main point is that because of this hard disk, now we cannot just turn off the power of the router any more. It has to be shut down gracefully like a PC. One way is to ssh/telnet to it and then give the &ldquo;halt&rdquo; command but then you have to switch on a PC specially just to turn off your router. Well not any more. I was looking for a better way to do this and just found out the simplest one. And if you are using Oleg&rsquo;s custom firmware then you are in luck too.
With the 1.9.2.7-g version of his firmware, oleg added a new feature with which if you press the **EZ Setup **button at the back of the router for 3 seconds, it executes a script &ldquo;/usr/local/sbin/ez-setup&rdquo;, if present. So, all you gotta do is create a new text file named &ldquo;ez-setup&rdquo;, and paste the following contents in it:</p></div><div><a class="read-more button inline" href=/2009/07/10/shutdown-asus-wl-500-w/></a></div></article><article class="post on-list"><h2 class=post-title><a href=https://shantanugoel.com/2009/07/07/virtualbox-high-cpu-usage-problem-solved/>VirtualBox High CPU Usage Problem Solved</a></h2><div class=post-meta><time class=post-date>2009-07-07</time><span class=post-author>Shantanu Goel</span></div><div class=post-content><p>A few days ago, I had to install Windows XP as a guest OS on my Ubuntu Hardy machine as I needed to carry out some Visual Studio work. What I noticed was that my CPU usage went through the roof (constantly at 100%) even if the guest was completely idle. Result: My laptop was shutting down within a few minutes because the CPU was heating up and its temperature going beyond 75C. And finally came to know a simple solution from a friend, that immediately worked. The solution was to create a new dummy guest machine in VirtualBox, allocate minimal RAM to it (I gave 4MB) and just run it, don‚Äôt even need to add boot disk to it and to my surprise, the CPU usage came down to just 3-4% immediately. I‚Äôm not sure why this issue is happening and how the dummy machine solved it but atleast it is working for me now. If you have a similar issue, you can try out the same.</p></div><div><a class="read-more button inline" href=/2009/07/07/virtualbox-high-cpu-usage-problem-solved/></a></div></article><article class="post on-list"><h2 class=post-title><a href=https://shantanugoel.com/2009/07/03/compiling-latest-firefly-mt-daapd-asus-wl-500w/>Compiling Latest FireFly (mt-daapd) for ASUS WL-500W</a></h2><div class=post-meta><time class=post-date>2009-07-03</time><span class=post-author>Shantanu Goel</span></div><div class=post-content><p>FireFly is a nice DAAP based media server that allows you to listen to your music collection anywhere using any DAAP based client like iTunes, with other players (like Winamp, Rhythmbox, VLC, etc) using plugins, or it even has its own dedicated php/flash/java based clients that can be fired up on any platform any computer giving you instant nirvana.</p><p>Many people, like me, use it on their Routers or NAS boxes to access their music anywhere without having to keep their home PC running or lugging around external drives. However, development on this gem stopped some time ago. The last stable build released (2.4.2) was good but it doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of features provided by the nightly builds in svn (subversion). And the last nightly build released (svn-1696) had a lot of broken things. It was rebuilding the database everytime, crashed around quite a bit, had a lot of security holes. So, I decided to get the latest version (trunk) of the FireFly code, as it had a lot of fixes for above issues, put in whatever was missing, and try to build it for my use.</p></div><div><a class="read-more button inline" href=/2009/07/03/compiling-latest-firefly-mt-daapd-asus-wl-500w/></a></div></article><article class="post on-list"><h2 class=post-title><a href=https://shantanugoel.com/2009/06/17/opera-web-server-browser-bad-idea/>Opera Web Server In A Browser: Bad Idea</a></h2><div class=post-meta><time class=post-date>2009-06-17</time><span class=post-author>Shantanu Goel</span></div><div class=post-content><p>Today, the whole word is going gaga over &ldquo;<a href=http://unite.opera.com/>Opera Unite</a>&rdquo;, the new technology in Opera 10 which will make your web browser a web server as well (and not just that, it will make a whole lot of ‚Äúsharing‚Äù options available). Well, I‚Äôm not so excited about it. Technology wise, it is really cool but what they don‚Äôt realize is that this is like giving motorized chain-saw or a swiss army knife in the hands of a two-year old. Seriously, majority of the people around the world who get themselves into all sorts of shit while just plain surfing the net, now got a whole new array of avenues where they can be exploited upon. For people who do need a webserver, there are plenty of straight-forward point and click options available. I hope they atleast have options to completely turn it off and even better, keep it turned off by default.</p></div><div><a class="read-more button inline" href=/2009/06/17/opera-web-server-browser-bad-idea/></a></div></article><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__buttons><a href=/posts/page/21/ class="button prev"><span class=button__icon>‚Üê</span>
