&lt;p>I love it. I love taking notes. I love saving all bits and bobs of information that I come across. Bookmarks, memes, quotes, code snippets, whatever. I love it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I run into a bunch of issues with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I can&amp;rsquo;t find them. I can&amp;rsquo;t remember them. I can&amp;rsquo;t use them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I spend a lot more time managing them than I do learning.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>I love it. I love taking notes. I love saving all bits and bobs of information that I come across. Bookmarks, memes, quotes, code snippets, whatever. I love it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I run into a bunch of issues with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I can&amp;rsquo;t find them. I can&amp;rsquo;t remember them. I can&amp;rsquo;t use them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I spend a lot more time managing them than I do learning.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I had an epiphany recently that why was I so miserable with my PKMs? In my quest for the perfect knowledge management system, I&amp;rsquo;ve made a lot of mistakes which lead to the above issues:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Trying to organize them very thoroughly. Create deeply thoughtful, insanely hierarchical structures of folders and files (or similar concepts represented in various apps)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Trying to do everything in a single app.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Running after a shit ton of features.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>PKMs should be more about &lt;em>Knowledge&lt;/em> and less about &lt;em>Management&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I remembered how I was amazed when I used gmail for the first time. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to create tons of nested folders. I used labels a bit, and they are insanely more powerful than folders. And rest I basically just used search. I had the same experience when I joined Google as an engineer and stopped organizing all my work docs in neat structures, because everything was just a search away, wherever they were whether a wiki or a text file or an email etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also remembered the unix philosophy of doing one thing well, and how that scales amazingly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, I set out to overhaul my PKM system a bit with these ideas in mind. I tried a lot of apps and settled on a few.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about what I chose and a bit about why, but what I will not talk about is their long list of features. Because like I said, that&amp;rsquo;s a slippery slope and I ruthlessly narrowed down my main criteria as:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Easy to store&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Easy to retrieve (on demand, as well as discovery)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Available cross platform (Windows, Linux, Mac, iOS, iPadOS, Chrome - since I use all these platforms)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I settled finally on three apps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://hoarder.app/">Hoarder&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://capacities.io/">Capacities&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://notability.com/">Notability&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now, I was using notability already since long for handwritten notes on my app. So that obviously remains in the stack. For a little while, I had tried to use OneNote instead in the allure of reducing an app to use since OneNote does both handwrittten and typed notes, but it&amp;rsquo;s such a bad UX and quite different and clunky across all platforms as well. So I will continue with Notability for this, and I type these out in my regular note app anyways while ending my day. I continue with taking handwritten notes because they are amazingly intuitive without breaking the flow when reading books or in meetings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now I use hoarder for bookmarks, and capacities for everything else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hoarder is a self hosted web app which also has mobile apps and extensions. It auto tags everything you share to it (One click on chrome, or share sheet on phone) using AI (You&amp;rsquo;ve to bring your own. I use Google Gemini 1.5 Flash). It also scrapes the content and downloads a clean readable version for offline use or if the pages go away, or can also store the full page archive/screenshots etc. In the time that I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it, it&amp;rsquo;s been so easy to store and search my bookmarks. But it also allows me to &lt;code>discover&lt;/code> them when I browse tags. I plan to write some code on top of it to show me a random unread bookmark every day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Capacities changed my view towards notes completely. The first time I opened it, I was weirded out. Because it does not even have a way to create a &amp;ldquo;note&amp;rdquo; per se and &amp;ldquo;organize&amp;rdquo; it. For capacities, everything is an object.
&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/2024/capacities.png" alt="Capacities">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What this means is that it liberates you from organizing your notes. You create objects (use built-in ones or define your own). E.g. I don&amp;rsquo;t need to figure out that a tip/how-to that I found goes under Linux or Windows or is it for my laptops or for my home lab components like the NAS or raspberry pi or whatever. It&amp;rsquo;s just a How To. I save it as a How To and then you can search for it when you want. I can use tags if I need, or can set various properties on the types (enabled by the Object Type system), and can easily link to other objects from anywhere which helps in the recall process, aided also by their amazing search. It has a ton of other features which I love as well but at the core of it, I think using this object system (think of it like a super lean and super fast notion) is what made me switch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hopefully, this is where my search for the perfect PKM system ends, as my searches for the stored knowledge start getting fulfilled.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Enabling ONVIF and RTSP in V380 Pro Bulb Camera from Amazon</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2024/12/19/onvif-rtsp-amazon-v380pro-bulb-camera/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2024 15:30:20 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2024/12/19/onvif-rtsp-amazon-v380pro-bulb-camera/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/2024/v380-pro-bulb-camera.jpg" alt="V380 Pro Bulb Camera">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I use a bulb camera from Amazon for my doorway, because it is very easy to set it up since just goes into the existing bulb socket without any additional wiring, and connects over wifi to my internet. Most of these cameras are based around V380 / V380 Pro platforms, which are typically nice to work with 3rd party software via the ONVIF and RTSP protocols. ONVIF allows good control over the camera besides just streaming, and RTSP allows you to only stream the camera feed to other devices, such as your phone or tablet. But basically the end result is that you can use great software like Synology Surveillance Station to monitor the camera and control it remotely, which is what I do. Or you could also use things like VLC on your computer to just watch the feed. If you really want to play around with it, you can install scrypted on a server and connect the camera to almost anything like Apple HomeKit or Google Home.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/2024/v380-pro-bulb-camera.jpg" alt="V380 Pro Bulb Camera">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Now, this has been working nicely for me for the last few years but suddenly my existing camera went kaput. I tried fixing it with a lot of (over)confidence in my abilities but couldn&amp;rsquo;t get it to work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Exhauted, I bought another one off Amazon which was similar but surprisingly it didn&amp;rsquo;t work with Synology. Scanning it via &lt;code>nmap&lt;/code>, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see any ports open either that could be onvif or rtsp related.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Searching on the internet, I found that you could put a file named &lt;code>ceshi.ini&lt;/code> on an sd card and put it in the camera with the content mentioning things like &lt;code>rtsp=1&lt;/code> and &lt;code>onvif=1&lt;/code> and this should enable it. But it didn&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was about to send it back to Amazon, but then for some reason decided to try other variants of this and finally the following content in the file worked for me. I put the file on the sd card and rebooted the camera and it finally started working.&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>rtsp_enable=1
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>onvif_enable=1
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Adding this here as a note for my future self because I have a knack of forgetting my own fixes and then running into them later on my own blog :D&lt;/p>

You think of something, design it and it appears in front of you. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t that be life-changing for you?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the sweet monsoons, some 25 years ago, a lot of Indian kids started dreaming of this when the show Shaka Laka Boom Boom went on air. It had a magical pencil that the show&amp;rsquo;s protagonist Sanju could use to draw anything, and it became a reality. Now, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really watch the show because I was already in my 20s by then and it felt too childish to me at the time.

&lt;p>In the sweet monsoons, some 25 years ago, a lot of Indian kids started dreaming of this when the show Shaka Laka Boom Boom went on air.

Now, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really watch the show because I was already in my 20s by then and it felt too childish to me at the time. But the kids around me could not stop singing praises about it and how they wanted to be the lucky Sanju.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I wasn&amp;rsquo;t alien to this longing, or feeling. I first had this feeling when I learned to code, another 15 years or so before this. Every Wednesday, I religiously took off my shoes outside the school&amp;rsquo;s computer lab, lest a smitten of dust bork the machines inside, cranked that key to unlock the CPU, inserted an 8-inch floppy diskette inside it to boot it to start coding those silly programs in BASIC.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/cpu-lock.jpg" alt="Alohamora">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was overjoyed when one day I learned I could draw circles on the screen through my programs. A decade later as I typed HTML in Notepad and saw all kinds of things happen on screen, I felt this is it!! And then as I waded further into programming through college and beyond, it just was as if a vast ocean had been suddenly unlocked for a frog, who had only so far jumped around in a puddle of mud, to swim in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I always thought this was the high point of my &amp;ldquo;creation&amp;rdquo; journey. That nothing could surpass this power that I held beneath my grubby little fingers as they danced around in motions not exceeding a couple of inches max and things happened. A lot of people talk about doing things other than programming. That they programmed so much at work and they needed to do something else to relax. For me, programming was (and in many ways, still is) relaxation. How could someone have a superpower and not always be reveling in joy using it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then around 2 years ago, I bought a 3D printer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/creality-ender-3-s1-pro.jpg" alt="">
&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/3d-rabbit.jpg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was my Shaka Laka Boom Boom moment. I could now understand why all those kids all those years ago went gaga over a silly pencil. I mean I could even now print a replica of that pencil at home. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve designed and printed nozzles for my Dyson vacuum, fixed and built toys for my little princess when she demanded them, fixes for my guitar, my bathroom door knobs, water alarms for my RO reject water tank when Bangalore suffers through a water crisis, a cover to save my steam deck when I travel, amazing projects for my teenage son, the iPhone nightstand that Apple showed in its keynote but never released, an Airtag case for the apple tv remote so I could never lose it again, tons of gifts for myself and friends. I&amp;rsquo;m a builder and a tinkerer. When people rush to call for help for any simple thing around the house, I rush towards my tool chest. And here I had a magic wand to now create the parts I needed to fix anything I wanted, whenever I wanted, and even create the tools to fix those parts. I mean I could even print a motha-fuckin&amp;rsquo; GODZILLA!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve printed all these and many many more things (You can see more on my &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/shantanugoel">Twitter&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://instagram.com/shantanugoel_">Instagram&lt;/a>). That combination of programming and 3d printing gives me a feeling of control over the virtual and parallel world, which is nothing short of feeling like the almighty Brahma, the Lord of Creation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If this is not life-changing, then what is?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A classic debate that keeps erupting now and then is whether it&amp;rsquo;s ok or not to continue to look for other jobs after signing an employment contract with a company, to get potentially a better offer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are good arguments from both sides. Employers expect you to commit/be good to your word and not continue shopping around a signed offer letter. Candidates believe that this is unfair since companies typically have a much heavier side already in the employment power equation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Emotions (and tempers) run high every time this gets discussed, and there&amp;rsquo;s seemingly no possible consensus in sight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I posit that this is simply an optimization problem to be solved by everyone for themselves. The rest of my notes below dig into a bit more detail on the potential ways in which this could be navigated by a candidate as well as a hiring manager.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ground-truths">Ground Truths&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Before we begin, we will set forth a few facts, and a few assumptions that I believe are true, to form the ground for our aforementioned digging. I have tons of anecdotes from my experience screening 10s of thousands, interviewing 1000s, and hiring 100s of people, but I won&amp;rsquo;t list any of them here because, in a rational discussion, anecdotes serve only as bias and nothing else.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="facts">Facts&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A company, though seemingly a faceless entity, is not taking a hiring decision as one. It&amp;rsquo;s the hiring manager (and sometimes recruiters/HR) who are taking them, partly guided by their motivations and partly by the company&amp;rsquo;s practices&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In a country like India, every position gets hundreds, if not thousands or 10s of thousands of applicants&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The world is not perfect. Although we want an ideal state on the other side, that will only come in a piecemeal fashion, not everywhere&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An offer is an offer until accepted/signed. Then it becomes a &amp;ldquo;contract&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="assumptions">Assumptions&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Most people want to work with other people that they can trust&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most people want to optimize hiring for themselves (Candidates for their career, hiring managers for their own, companies for their profits)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="common-scenarios">Common scenarios&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It is assumed that the ideal state is where the below issues don&amp;rsquo;t happen.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Company&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Gives exploding offers (Accept/Reject in 1-2 days or the offer goes away)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Give out offers as an x% increment based on past compensation&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Candidate&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Wants another offer even after accepting one because
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>That will bring in another 10-20% hike&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Or they had to take a bad offer earlier (either much lower money than they are worth, or a company that they don&amp;rsquo;t really want to go to) because they were desperate and had no other choice&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="is-reneging-on-a-contract-bad">Is reneging on a contract bad?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The answer is &lt;strong>NO&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One would be naive to think of this in terms of good/bad because that&amp;rsquo;s not what matters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You may have a genuine reason, or you may have a completely frivolous reason to renege. The company may be a 10000 people/trillion$ behemoth barely impacted by a particular candidate&amp;rsquo;s decision or a barely surviving 2 people startup that will go under because of it. The outcomes may be wildly different depending on who&amp;rsquo;s on the other end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The real questions to ask are:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>1. Can there be trust in this relationship being built on top of a reneged contract?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The answer to this is the same as asking whether you can build a stable house on a shaky foundation. A house may still fall even if there were no apparent cracks in the foundation, but if you see visible cracks already you would think twice about building a house on top of it. This is true for any relationship whether friendship, love, or employment. You can choose to take a risk and turn out lucky, but many may be risk averse and avoid it (to their benefit or detriment ultimately, but that&amp;rsquo;s beside the fact).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2. Now that I know this, what should I do?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The answer is simple. &lt;strong>Optimize for yourself&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Implementation though, as usual, is much harder and one has to decide for themselves and their situation what they want to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An ideal hiring manager would optimize for the long term, purely on the skills of the candidate in their
An ideal candidate would optimize for their long-term career, choose a company that plays by the rules, treats their employees well, is fair in compensation at the hiring stage and later on&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The world is far from ideal though. An ideal hiring manager and an ideal candidate are hard to find and for good reason because both are burnt by bad experiences on the other side.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thus I don&amp;rsquo;t prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach and everyone chooses some shade of grey instead of being perfectly black or white. One can optimize for the short term or the long term, and optimize on different metrics, but always optimize knowing what you are optimizing for and what you are trading off against. Because if you don&amp;rsquo;t think of the complete picture, you run the risk of getting stuck in a local maxima.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="local-maxima-optimization-risks">Local maxima optimization risks&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>For Hiring Manager&lt;/strong>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Lose out on good candidates if you pass on candidates coming to you after reneging on a contract
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Typically not that big a problem for companies since there are many other good candidates to choose from&lt;/li>
&lt;li>However, there&amp;rsquo;s no guarantee that the candidates who didn&amp;rsquo;t renege on offers won&amp;rsquo;t just leave quite quickly after joining&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hire a fleeing candidate, if you choose to hire a candidate who reneged on another contract
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The candidate that you hired after they broke off their contract with another company, won&amp;rsquo;t they break yours right after they sign it&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>For Candidate&lt;/strong>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Lose out on good companies
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Typically a company/hiring manager that wants to do the right thing/be ideal, also expects the candidates to be ideal.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Get into a bad company
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A company that was willing to get you to break another contract for themselves, how empathetic would they be when it comes to breaking their contract with you?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As is usual, the risks for the candidate far outweigh those for the company, but such is life. Neither you/nor I can change this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But what this means is that if you feel that really had to sign a bad contract in desperation and surely need to go to a better company/offer, while knowing the risks, go for it. But if it&amp;rsquo;s because you just want to keep getting the highest bid on the market if it&amp;rsquo;s probably another 5/10% more, maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve given in to the greed a bit too much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Again, it&amp;rsquo;s for you to decide for yourself without caring about what the current/future hiring manager will think. Because irrespective of your circumstances, they&amp;rsquo;d form their opinion based on their own biases/experiences/policies and act accordingly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Similarly, ideally, a hiring manager would listen to every case, devote ample time to it understand the genuine reasons behind them, and take the candidates through. But the sheer glut of applications would mean it&amp;rsquo;s an easy optimization for a hiring manager to apply as a filter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll likely be crucified to say this, because no one wants to hear it. &lt;strong>The best optimization, with the least trade-offs, as a candidate is likely to build in that optionality for yourself. Where you are so good that you can take the liberty to say No to bad companies and bad offers.&lt;/strong> This isn&amp;rsquo;t always possible, but we can at least strive for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-i-dobelieve">What I do/believe&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note again, dear reader, that this is merely what I do or believe. I do not prescribe you to follow the same. Find your own optimization strategy.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Be upfront and honest with the candidates about the compensation, the process, the hikes they can expect, and everything else, because a foundation built on trust lasts long&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make the team/company not only about the offer but strive to make it a place where people would want to join and stay&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Always make an offer in line with the range of that role
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Does not form a basis on previous compensation or other offers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fair to existing employees and all other hires as well since everyone remains on par&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ok with candidates in the interview process with multiple companies, have received other offers, want to use those offers to negotiate&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Never compare candidates, evaluate them in their absolute sense, and hire as soon as one meets the bar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Give reasonable time for candidates to accept offers
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Typically at least 1-2 weeks, but more if the candidate is waiting for other offers and is upfront about it&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the candidate has already signed a contract, then typically I&amp;rsquo;d want to avoid going forward with their candidature
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Unless they have a genuine reason not because of a meagre hike. But generally, the volume of applications and the inability to sufficiently distinguish genuine reasons from a lie serves as a detriment against going into the details of this for most cases&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I know the risks for me as a hiring manager that I outlined above, but I can choose to take those risks&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4 id="as-a-candidate">As a candidate&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Be upfront and honest with my potential employer(s), because a foundation built on trust lasts long&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If one does need to renege on a contract, communicate in time and honestly about it to avoid burning bridges&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Say NO, liberally. Many times when you think saying no means you will lose out results in either of these two scenarios:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The company was never worth it to work for anyways&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The company buckled in and towed your line&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Holding a grudge against someone who reneged on an offer (I&amp;rsquo;m actually happy if this happens because this reduces the chances of a much bigger burden on my team where someone joins and then quickly leaves because they already had one foot out the door)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Adding penalty clauses in contracts&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Blacklisting candidates/forming a cartel or cabal to share their names&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cooking up lies&lt;/li>

So, naturally I use headphones a lot, especially due to the video calls situation forced by the pandemic. Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve been having this uneasy feeling for a long time which is sort of like a headache but not really and it&amp;rsquo;s been gnawing at me. I attributed this to lack of sleep, stress, etc early on but then recently realized the main culprit for this is headphones that&amp;rsquo;s constantly keeping my ears busy. I used to use mostly IEMs for their better sound and isolation. Tried over the ears headphones but it didn&amp;rsquo;t really help much. People suggested using open back headphones and those helped but not much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Things got so bad that I felt irritated all the time and started dreading any calls as it seemed to not just cause me issues in ears/head but an overall fatigue. Then finally decided to completely let go of headphones but that meant I had to find appropriate replacements for my routine (noise-free calls, good enough music while working, good enough music while running/working out). After a lot of trial and error, have finally stumbled on to a setup that works out pretty great.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="hardware">Hardware&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>An old google home that was lying unused ever since I moved to the nest hub&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bone condution headsets (Aftershokz OpenMove. Wanted to buy the Aeropex but it seems to be out of stock everywhere)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Logitech C930e (for the microphone)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="conference-calls--meetings">Conference calls / Meetings&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Using Google home was a cinch for the incoming sound. Connected my laptop to the Google home via BT and the effect was immediately noticeable. First my ears didn&amp;rsquo;t feel any pressure at all, and they didn&amp;rsquo;t get hot as well like they used to earlier. Secondly, the voices were much heavier/bassy so that helped ease the load on my ears as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next challenge was the outgoing sound/microphone (since Google home mic cannot be used for calls via laptop) and to keep it sufficiently noise free. I decided to use the mic on my Logitech C930e for this. Now I&amp;rsquo;ve tried various microphones in the past including the ones on my headsets, the one in the laptop, and external ones like Blue Yeti and ATR2100USB and always came out unimpressed. The issues with them are that generally they are too sensitive and they pick up not just my voice but also any other sound nearby, or even the noises coming from outside my home office like kids shouting or a neighbor hammering away on their wall etc. ATR2100USB, being a dynamic mic with a helpful cardiod pattern, fairs better but I had to keep it quite close to me to be useful. The logitech C930 helps a lot with this. It has actually 2 microphones and both of them are unidirectional/cardioid. Using this, I figured out that it was able to easily get all of my voice easily recorded while not capturing any of the vocal or other sounds happening more than a few feet away from me. This coupled with the built-in noise cancellation capabilities of most meeting sofware of today (I tried Google meet, Zoom, Microsoft Teams), I could get perfect output. I was a little worried that the sound of others speaking during the call which was coming out of the google home will cause issues/feedback, but it seems that all the meeting software do a very good job of removing this and I did not face any issues of the output audio getting routed back to input. Couple of things I had to do to get the setup perfect were:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Select the &amp;ldquo;digital&amp;rdquo; interface device for the microphone of c930e (In archlinux/kde, this mic shows up with 2 entries one for analog and another for digital. The analog one captures all the unfiltered audio, including noise, just like other mics I tested while the digital one works better)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Had to set the gain of mic at ~90% in the settings to tailor it appropriately for my seating distance from the mic&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="listening-to-music-while-working">Listening to music while working&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I started using just Google home for this. Not only this serves my purpose well when I am listening to music exclusively (Google home has surprisingly good sound for its size), but even when I am working I can now listen to music witout getting distracted. I set the volume to 5% and it keeps playing in the background as a nice backdrop to my work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="listening-to-music-while-running">Listening to music while running&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This was the last issue for me as I really like music while running. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cruisemaniac">Ashwin&lt;/a> suggested to try out bone conduction headsets as he has been using these for a while. I was a bit skeptical at first but decided to give these a go. Researching on these I figured that Aftershokz Aeropex are the current state of the art/top of the line in this area but sadly they are nowhere to be found right now. Thankfully, they&amp;rsquo;ve launched the &amp;ldquo;Openmove&amp;rdquo; model recently which is supposed to be quite close to the aeropex in audio quality. I got these last week and have been using these during my runs. TBH, they aren&amp;rsquo;t anywhere close to the audio experience of an IEM but they are decent enough. A side bonus is that I have my ears open to the nearby sounds of traffic or any other things happening around me since I like to run in the open, not on a treadmill.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With these changes, I feel a lot more energetic through the day and feel that not just my ears but overall health has improved a lot.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Pradyumn's got a website</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2021/01/09/pradyumn-coding-website/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jan 2021 13:21:55 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2021/01/09/pradyumn-coding-website/</guid><description>&lt;p>My 10yo (Pradyumn) got interested in coding last year.

I wasn&amp;rsquo;t so sure about it in the beginning since I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to force my career choices or interests on to him. But I realized that he wanted to do it of his own accord, so I agreed to help him. But our deal was that I will introduce him a bit to the learning resources and help him out with his doubts here and there, while he will peruse all the learning material and build his things on his own without much interference/interaction with me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I took the regular path of introducing him to &lt;a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">scratch&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://code.org">code.org&lt;/a> initially, since that&amp;rsquo;s what I have seen being recommended for kids at many places. He got bored of them quite quickly though as he didn&amp;rsquo;t feel that he was coding enough, plus he felt limited in expressing himself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I then gave him a &lt;a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">python book&lt;/a> and he spent a couple of months learning that. He was quite into it and made few programs and games with the concepts he learnt from here. He felt quite happy with it except that he was mostly restricted to the command line programs. He found out about pygame and made a few graphical games which gave him a new high, but felt let down when he learnt he couldn&amp;rsquo;t share them easily with his friends and family since there was no easy packaging mechanism, plus a lot of the folks he wanted to share them with would just see it on the phone/tablets etc which won&amp;rsquo;t run python stuff anyways. He did find a few sites/programs that promised to translate these programs to mobile apps and all but they all seemed to have tricky corners to navigate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At this point, instead of having his time spent in packaging etc, I introduced him to the idea of learning HTML/CSS/Javascript. I myself don&amp;rsquo;t have much experience in the field of programming for the web, but I felt (and was instantly vindicated seeing his face light up) that this path will help achieve his goals and motivate him to keep learning. He researched about resources on this for a few days and asked me to buy him a couple of udemy courses which I did. He&amp;rsquo;s been going through this over the past month and made a couple of programs and a website to showcase them. As an aside, he also learnt a bit of git and github. I connected a domain to his github repository and here it is: &lt;a href="https://pradyumngoel.com/">https://pradyumngoel.com/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t really have any hopes/wishes linked to this, as I would fully support him to go into whichever field he likes. But the first step towards that is that the kids get to experience the various things that are available to them as choices. He&amp;rsquo;s been trying various sports and other activities in the past and I&amp;rsquo;m glad he is keen towards learning new things on his own and expanding his horizons.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>A nifty window layout switcher for macOS using Hammerspoon</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2020/08/21/hammerspoon-multiscreen-window-layout-macos/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Aug 2020 23:07:59 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2020/08/21/hammerspoon-multiscreen-window-layout-macos/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a sucker for screen real estate, and thus I use 2 32&amp;quot; 4k monitors so I can see most of my apps&amp;rsquo; windows simultaneously, instead of switching back and forth between them.&lt;/p>

It also puts a handy menu in the menubar that allows me to launch the apps or switch between various options. It also shows a number &amp;ldquo;1&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;3&amp;rdquo; adjacent to the menu icon to display what layout I&amp;rsquo;m currently using. Pretty nifty!&lt;/p>

There is a con as well that such files are not available for someone going through the code statically for understanding or debugging. But one could always couple both methods if so desired.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had a need to generate some files for a side project of mine recently and I thought of listing down the way I achieve this with bazel, particularly the last mechanism mentioned above. So, our (simplified) problem statement is:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Our primary code is in &lt;code>main.cc&lt;/code> which needs to include an auto-generated header file &lt;code>header.h&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>header.h&lt;/code> is generated by running a tool &lt;code>header_generator&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>header_generator&lt;/code> is built by compiling &lt;code>header_generator.cc&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We only want to run a single build step of building our primary target. Rest should happen on its own flowing through the dependency logic.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>To achieve this, we should move in the reverse dependency order. First, let&amp;rsquo;s define the straight forward target of &lt;code>header_generator&lt;/code>. This target does not have any dependency and can build standalonea as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>cc_binary(
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> name &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;header_generator&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> srcs &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> [&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;header_generator.cc&amp;#34;&lt;/span>],
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Next, we define a target that will generate our library that builds &lt;code>header.h&lt;/code>. If this was a hand-written or pre-generated file, the target would&amp;rsquo;ve been simply:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>cc_library(
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> name &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;header&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> hdrs &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> [&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;header.h&amp;#34;&lt;/span>],
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>But this file does not exist in our tree and so bazel wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know how to make sense of it. So, we replace the &lt;code>hdrs&lt;/code> field of the library with another target (&lt;a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/general.html#genrule">genrule&lt;/a>) instead, which generates a rule on the fly.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Bazel documentation: A genrule generates one or more files using a user-defined Bash command. Genrules are generic build rules that you can use if there&amp;rsquo;s no specific rule for the task.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>genrule(
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> name &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;generate_header&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> outs &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> [&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;header.h&amp;#34;&lt;/span>],
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> cmd &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;./$(location :header_generator) &amp;gt; $@&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> tools &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> [&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;:header_generator&amp;#34;&lt;/span>],
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>cc_library(
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> name &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;header&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> hdrs &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> [&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;:generate_header&amp;#34;&lt;/span>],
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This target runs the command specified in the &lt;code>cmd&lt;/code> property as a bash command. The command uses the tool label mentioned in the tools property to figure out any tools&amp;rsquo; targets that need to be built before running this. &lt;code>location&lt;/code> attribute is used to refer to the final compiled binary of the associated tool and then it redirects the output to the filename mentioned in &lt;code>outs&lt;/code> property.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, we just plumb this with our primary target normally, making it dependent on the target that contains the generated header file.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>cc_binary(
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> name &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;main&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> srcs &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> [&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;main.cc&amp;#34;&lt;/span>],
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> deps &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> [&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;:header&amp;#34;&lt;/span>],
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>With these set of rules, whenever I run &lt;code>bazel run //src:main&lt;/code>, bazel will first compile the &lt;code>header_generator&lt;/code> binary, then run this binary to generate &lt;code>header.h&lt;/code> file and finally compile &lt;code>main.cc&lt;/code> along with these depdenencies and then run the final binary.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Java "Object" in C++ using std::variant</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2020/04/27/java-object-cpp-std-variant/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2020 19:39:50 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2020/04/27/java-object-cpp-std-variant/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m going through this brilliant book, &lt;a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting Interpreters&lt;/a>, these days to learn more about how interpreters are built.

In one of the chapters, the author uses a Java &amp;ldquo;Object&amp;rdquo; class to hold the literal values that may appear in the script being parsed by the interpreter. Java docs say that:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Class &lt;code>Object&lt;/code> is the root of the class hierarchy. Every class has Object as a superclass. All objects, including arrays, implement the methods of this class.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So, this threw a bit of a spanner in the works for me since C++ does not really have any equivalent class which all classes derive from. Going through the options available, I stumbled upon &lt;code>std::conditional&lt;/code> and &lt;code>std::variant&lt;/code> that could be of help. From cppreference:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>std::conditional&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Defined in header &amp;lt;type_traits&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>template&amp;lt; bool B, class T, class F &amp;gt;
struct conditional; (since C++11)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Provides member typedef type, which is defined as T if B is true at compile time, or as F if B is false.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>std::variant&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Defined in header &amp;lt;variant&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>template &amp;lt;class&amp;hellip; Types&amp;gt;
class variant; (since C++17)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The class template std::variant represents a type-safe union. An instance of std::variant at any given time either holds a value of one of its alternative types, or in the case of error&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;code>std::conditional&lt;/code> seems to be much more straight forward to use if you have only two types to choose from. But I needed more than 2 right now, and they could increase in future as well if I started supporting more types. Thus, I went with &lt;code>std::variant&lt;/code>. You can think of this as a safer version of a union. So, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how to achieve my goal of emulating a Java Object-like class using std::variant and the visitor pattern. Another thing I needed to do was to convert the value into a string, irrespective of which type it was, so we will see how I did that as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The code is pretty straight forward. First we declare a new type alias called &lt;code>Object&lt;/code>. This refers to an std::variant which can take std::nullptr_t, std::string, a double or a bool types.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> Object &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> std&lt;span style="color:#f92672">::&lt;/span>variant&lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;&lt;/span>std&lt;span style="color:#f92672">::&lt;/span>nullptr_t, std&lt;span style="color:#f92672">::&lt;/span>string, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">double&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">bool&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;gt;&lt;/span>;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Next we create a helper function that encapsulates our cute little trick to convert any incoming object into a string in C++ with minimal code.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">template&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">typename&lt;/span> T&lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;gt;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">static&lt;/span> std&lt;span style="color:#f92672">::&lt;/span>string VisitorHelper(T x) {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> std&lt;span style="color:#f92672">::&lt;/span>stringstream temp;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> temp &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span> x;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> temp.str();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now, we could create tons of boilerplate code using things like &lt;code>std::get&lt;/code>/&lt;code>std::get_if&lt;/code>/&lt;code>std::in_place_index&lt;/code> etc to start using our Object. But we want to be smart and avoid all this. So, we use a visitor pattern. You can read this awesomely simple &lt;a href="https://www.bfilipek.com/2018/06/variant.html">article&lt;/a> by Bartlomiej Filipek to understand your options better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We create a &lt;code>Visitor&lt;/code> struct which contains the overloads for the operator(), which will call the appropriate implementation based on the type of the value of our instance. You can create other operator overloads as well here if you need. Note that in all the cases we are calling our templatized VisitorHelper which helps in converting the value to a string and return that.&lt;/p>

I went the struct way because ultimately I want to be able to do diffferent actions depending on the type, so I need different implementations for them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;em>Side note 2&lt;/em>:&lt;/em> A friend pointed out that I could use &lt;code>std::any&lt;/code> here as well. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t choose to use it because of the similar issues I mentioned earlier that it requires boilerplate for figuring out the type (e.g. in a switch case) and then getting the value after typecasting it appropriately.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Automatic notes backup on macOS with hammerspoon</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2020/03/20/hammerspoon-backup-joplin-notes-dotfiles-git-macos/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Mar 2020 18:25:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2020/03/20/hammerspoon-backup-joplin-notes-dotfiles-git-macos/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a backup nerd and like to back-up everything I do.

Apart from being all kinds of nerds, I&amp;rsquo;m an automation nerd too, which is a fancy way of saying that I am lazy, but I digress.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, essentially I wanted to commit and push changes to my notes, dotfiles and few other things automatically whenever I make changes. I came across a tool called &lt;a href="https://github.com/gitwatch/gitwatch">gitwatch&lt;/a>, which can help do this. But I wanted to try out some more capabilities of &lt;a href="https://www.hammerspoon.org/">Hammerspoon&lt;/a>, so I chose that as my weapon of choice for this, especially because I already use it for few other automations so that&amp;rsquo;s one (or more) less things to install/maintain/update. Hammerspoon is an extremely powerful tool for macOS. In its own words:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>At its core, Hammerspoon is just a bridge between the operating system and a Lua scripting engine. What gives Hammerspoon its power is a set of extensions that expose specific pieces of system functionality, to the user.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So, the things I had to do:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Setup the directories of my dotfiles (&lt;code>~/dotfiles/&lt;/code>) and notes (&lt;code>~/.config/Joplin-desktop/&lt;/code>) as git repositories (by running git init inside them)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create repositories on GitHub (and other servers as needed) to backup them to. You can create them as private if you want to. In my case, my dotfiles are public but my notes are private.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add the upstream repositories to your local git repositories as remotes (&lt;code>git remote add &amp;lt;somename&amp;gt; &amp;lt;remote_url&amp;gt;&lt;/code>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add my ssh keys to the ssh-agent using the &lt;code>ssh-add&lt;/code> command. You can read more about this &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent">here&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Save the below lua script to &lt;code>~/.hammerspoon/git-backup.lua&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

To get the best network with the new gigabit ethernet port on the raspi, and still save power, I added a PoE hat to it so I could power the raspi as well as provide it data through the ethernet port. Everything worked fine except that I ocassionaly got into situations where the raspi stopped responding suddenly. Initially I thought that it&amp;rsquo;s crashing due to some issues and used to just restart it manually. I tried switching from manjaro-arm to raspbian as well but that showed same symptoms, despite updating to the latest bootloader and firmware as well. Then I noticed that I could hear the fans on the PoE hat whirring up and settling down even when the raspi was inaccessible. This put me in a doubt that the raspi hasn&amp;rsquo;t actually crashed, because the fans whir up and go down according to the CPU temperature.

&lt;p>I tried several things by updating the kernel, picking up several patches, trying different distros but nothing helped. I also found a few such issues reported on raspi&amp;rsquo;s forums/elsewhere without much updates and with/without the PoE hat. Ultimately, I tried a simple solution of resetting ethernet via &lt;code>ethtool&lt;/code> when the issue happens and it worked fine as a workaround. If you see this issue as well and want to employ this workaround, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy to do via creating the following 3 files (Note: I&amp;rsquo;ve used systemd timers here. You could instead do it through cron as well).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="file-1-monitorsh">File 1: monitor.sh&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This file has the code to check the network state and reset ethernet&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This blog is generated using hugo, an awesome static site generator. So far, the workflow I used to deploy it was:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Push commit to the source repository on GitLab&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>CI downloads latest version of hugo and generates the static site&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Runs aws-cli to sync the new files to AWS S3&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>S3 serves the static site&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cloudflare provides:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>DNS services (so I can use &lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com">https://shantanugoel.com&lt;/a> without having to prefix it with a &lt;code>www&lt;/code>)&lt;/li>

&lt;p>I was mostly happy with this setup with a couple of niggles at the back of my mind, vis. a vis.:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>aws s3 sync was finicky sometimes and sometimes, albeit rarely, the sync didn&amp;rsquo;t complete&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It took a long time to deploy a new update. Whenever I made a new post, it took around 5 minutes or more to appear due to issues stemming from GitLab CI taking time but mostly due to the time spent in s3 sync.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I also wanted to reduce the moving parts. I could have used GitLab pages but they&amp;rsquo;ve proved unreliable whenever I tried to use them&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the files ran into 10s of thousands, if I did lot of updates, I started running into incurring some cost due to S3 API usage. Especially because it was hard to upload only changed files. I tried few methods with hashes etc and it could be improved further but still I wanted to get rid of this issue.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Finally, the last push was announcement of &lt;a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions&lt;/a>. I had the itch, as usual, to try out the new and shiny, and so here we are.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="what-all-i-need-is-everything">What? All I need is everything&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>So, what I wanted to do was replace the source storage (GitLab to GitHub), CI (GitLab to GitHub Actions) and site host (AWS S3 to GitHub Pages). I kept Cloudflare&amp;rsquo;s DNS and CDN services as is because they are awesome, and I still want to continue to use the naked domain without &lt;code>www&lt;/code>.
Another thing I wanted while going this way was to keep the source repository and pages repository on GitHub separate because I want to be able to keep drafts in GitHub without having them available publicly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll see in the next section how all this was put together.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-lets-get-our-hands-dirty-shall-we">How? Let&amp;rsquo;s get our hands dirty, shall we!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The migration turned out to be pretty simple. This is how my setup looks like now:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Made a private source repository at GitHub, let&amp;rsquo;s call this &lt;code>shantanugoel.com-source&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This repository will be used to contain the website&amp;rsquo;s source&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Made another public repository which will contain our published site, e.g. &lt;a href="https://github.com/shantanugoel/shantanugoel.com">https://github.com/shantanugoel/shantanugoel.com&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Go to the settings section of this repository (e.g. &lt;a href="https://github.com/shantanugoel/shantanugoel.com/settings/">https://github.com/shantanugoel/shantanugoel.com/settings/&lt;/a> ) and set it to serve GitHub pages from the master branch&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Go to the Deploy Keys section of this repository (e.g. &lt;a href="https://github.com/shantanugoel/shantanugoel.com/settings/keys">https://github.com/shantanugoel/shantanugoel.com/settings/keys&lt;/a> ) and generate a deploy key with write access to the repository. Copy this key somewhere as you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to see this again.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Go to your source repository&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>Secrets&lt;/code> section (e.g. &lt;a href="https://github.com/shantanugoel/shantanugoel.com-source/settings/secrets">https://github.com/shantanugoel/shantanugoel.com-source/settings/secrets&lt;/a> ), and click on &amp;ldquo;Add a new secret&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Add a new secret named &lt;code>ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY&lt;/code> and set its value to the key that you copied in previous step.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This secret will be used in the action workflow that you&amp;rsquo;ll create in the next step.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Added a GitHub Action workflow specification to the repository at this location relative to root of repository &lt;code>.github/workflows/deploy.yml&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The filename can be anything ending in &lt;code>.yml&lt;/code> and written in YAML, but the directory path needs to be exactly as above.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The contents of the file are below. I&amp;rsquo;ve used comments in the contents to explain their usage.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Came across &lt;a href="https://bazel.build/">bazel&lt;/a> build system recently at my new job and found it to be quite nice compared to my earlier mainstays CMake and Make. It&amp;rsquo;s fast and correct, just as their website says. But I also liked it because it&amp;rsquo;s explicit with very little magic. And it has a powerful query/tools system that allows you to really analyze your builds and dependencies in depth. Though examples in the wild are a bit less since it is a fairly recent entrant compared to its competitors. For a personal side project, I needed to use SDL2 and it was the first time I had to use an external/pre-built library with bazel. This post documents the process I used for my own future reference and may be help some other lost soul like me. Although, the post talks about SDL2 here specifically, the same process can be used for most other external pre-compiled modules.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;h2 id="bazel">Bazel&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Update your &lt;code>WORKSPACE&lt;/code> file (resides at the root of your project) with below content. This is important because bazel does all the build steps in a sandbox and one cannot depend on anything outside this sandbox. This step allows bazel to make the content present at this path available to the sandbox as a bazel repository.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Note the &lt;code>build_file&lt;/code> parameter. This tells bazel how to use this repository. This can be anything according to what you want, the path being relative to the project root.

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The important portions here are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>copts&lt;/code>: To let bazel know where to search for SDL2 header files. Note that the path here is relative to project root.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>linkopts&lt;/code>: Need the &lt;code>-F&lt;/code> option to let compiler know where to search for the framework files and &lt;code>-framework&lt;/code> option as usual to link to ZSDL2. The path with &lt;code>-F&lt;/code> can be absolute one. Not sure why this is not restricted by the sandbox. Investigating this currently.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>deps&lt;/code>: Finally, create the explicit dependency on your sdl2 module by referring to it as &lt;code>@sdl2&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>By now, the project is ready to be compiled and linked.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Practical Reverse Engineering Tutorials Part 2: Protostar Stack4</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2017/12/04/practical-reverse-engineering-tutorial-2-protostar-stack4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Dec 2017 21:04:24 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2017/12/04/practical-reverse-engineering-tutorial-2-protostar-stack4/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-the-challenge">About the challenge&lt;/h2>

&lt;h2 id="recon">Recon&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Assuming you&amp;rsquo;ve done the setup as needed for Part 1 of this series, we straight away jump to run the challenge to see what we are after.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>user@protostar:/opt/protostar/bin$ ./stack4
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>ABCD
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>user@protostar:/opt/protostar/bin$
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>So, we see that the program asks for some user input. When we input &amp;lsquo;ABCD&amp;rsquo;, nothing happens. That&amp;rsquo;s a bummer. We need to move to the static analysis to map out our next actions. Remember, it might be easier to look at the source code of the challenge (and it will also not give much away) but we&amp;rsquo;ll still try to avoid source code as much as possible to give more exercise to our brains.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="static-analysis">Static Analysis&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We first run our staple &lt;code>strings&lt;/code> on the program to list interesting text data.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>user@protostar:/opt/protostar/bin$ strings stack4

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>__gmon_start__
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>libc.so.6
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>_IO_stdin_used
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>gets
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>puts
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>__libc_start_main
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>GLIBC_2.0
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>PTRh
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">[&lt;/span>^_&lt;span style="color:#f92672">]&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>code flow successfully changed
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>user@protostar:/opt/protostar/bin$
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>We see a potentially useful string &lt;code>code flow successfully changed&lt;/code> straight away. I&amp;rsquo;d wager a guess that we&amp;rsquo;ve to get our currently dumb program to emit this string somehow. Let&amp;rsquo;s see what is the condition under which this string is being printed. So we bring out gdb like last time and check the disassembled code of main function.&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">(&lt;/span>gdb&lt;span style="color:#f92672">)&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s interesting. So there&amp;rsquo;s no way main can print the string we&amp;rsquo;re after because there&amp;rsquo;s no print/puts call in here. Interestingly, main makes only one function call to &lt;code>gets&lt;/code> to get user input and there&amp;rsquo;s no other function being called at all. This would mean that the string is being printed from somewhere else and our challenge is to get that code executed. We know from the previous challenge we solved that to print this string, the program would need to pass a pointer to it as a parameter to a output function (like &lt;code>puts&lt;/code>). So to find that where this string is getting printed from, we&amp;rsquo;ve to first the address where this string is located and then search for reference to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You may know that there are various sections in an executable file. Generally, the executable portion is part of a section called &lt;code>.text&lt;/code> and literal strings are part of a section called &lt;code>.rodata&lt;/code>. So, our technique here would be to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Get the section addresses (Using &lt;code>maintenance info sections&lt;/code> gdb command)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Search for the string&amp;rsquo;s address in .rodata section (using &lt;code>find &amp;lt;section_start_address&amp;gt; &amp;lt;section_end_address&amp;gt; &amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/code> gdb command)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Search for a reference to the string&amp;rsquo;s address in .text section (using &lt;code>find &amp;lt;section_start_address&amp;gt; &amp;lt;section_end_address&amp;gt; &amp;lt;string_address&amp;gt;&lt;/code> gdb command)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This is shown below:&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>So, we need to make our program start executing at 0x80483f4 (Entry point of function &lt;code>win&lt;/code>) somehow.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="a-primer-about-x86-stack-frames">A primer about X86 stack frames&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Before continuing further, we will have to learn a bit about how program control works through stack frames. A stack frame is a region on the stack particular to a single function being executed in the call flow and represents its execution environment. If the same function is called many times, each instance of calling that function will have its own stack frame on the stack. A stack frame typically consists of:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Parameters passed to the function&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Return address (Code location to jump to after the function is complete)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pointer to the previous (Calling function&amp;rsquo;s) stack frame&amp;rsquo;s base&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Local variables&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s see with the help of a small example how this works.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="sample-code">Sample Code&lt;/h4>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span> x &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">2&lt;/span>;

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">main&lt;/span>()
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This will compile to the following assembly code&lt;/p>

&lt;h4 id="important-registers">Important registers&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The x86 registers that one would be most interested in while understanding stack frames are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>esp: Stack Pointer. Points to (Holds address of) the current top of the stack&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ebp: Base Pointer. Points to (Holds address of) the base of the current stack frame&lt;/li>
&lt;li>eip: Instruction Pointer. Points to (Holds address of) the next instruction to be executed in the program&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4 id="calling-convention--function-parameters">Calling Convention / Function Parameters&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>In the x86 calling convention, the parameters being passed to a function and the return address are pushed onto the stack before calling it. This can be seen in the below instruction.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-asm" data-lang="asm">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">mov&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">DWORD&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">PTR&lt;/span> [&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">esp&lt;/span>],&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">eax&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">call&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">0x80483ed&lt;/span> &amp;lt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">foo&lt;/span>&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Here, the &lt;code>mov&lt;/code> instruction is pushing the parameter &amp;lsquo;5&amp;rsquo; onto the stack.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;code>call&lt;/code> instruction is equivalent of pushing &lt;code>eip + 2&lt;/code> onto the stack and then jumping to the called function&amp;rsquo;s address. &lt;code>eip + 2&lt;/code> here points to the address of the instruction that should be executed next after returning from the called function.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="function-prologue--entry-sequence">Function Prologue / Entry Sequence&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>At the very beginning of a function, the first work done is to save the calling function&amp;rsquo;s base pointer (ebp) onto the stack and then move the current function&amp;rsquo;s base pointer to point towards calling function&amp;rsquo;s top. This can be seen in these instructions:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-asm" data-lang="asm">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>foo:
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">push&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">ebp&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">mov&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">ebp&lt;/span>,&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">esp&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h4 id="local-variables">Local Variables&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Then, space is created on the stack for holding any local variables.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-asm" data-lang="asm">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">sub&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">esp&lt;/span>,&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">0x10&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h4 id="exit-sequence">Exit Sequence&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Finally, after the function has executed, it returns by restoring the calling function&amp;rsquo;s base pointer and then popping the next value (return address) from stack into the eip.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-asm" data-lang="asm">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">leave&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">ret&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Here, &lt;code>leave&lt;/code> is equivalent of &lt;code>pop ebp&lt;/code> to restore ebp value. &lt;code>ret&lt;/code> is equivalent of &lt;code>pop eip&lt;/code> to start executing the next instruction after the function call.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="what-we-need-to-do">What we need to do&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>From the above analysis of the stack frame, we now know that:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Program flow is controlled through eip register&lt;/li>
&lt;li>On returning from a called function, eip register is updated with a value (return address) from the stack&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If we can somehow overflow a local variable on stack to modify the return address accurately, we can control the program execution.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Note that similar to the function &lt;code>foo&lt;/code>, even the function &lt;code>main&lt;/code> has its own stack frame and returns back to &amp;ldquo;something&amp;rdquo; after completing its execution. This &amp;ldquo;something&amp;rdquo; is the c library runtime against which the compiler linked the program. So we can even try to change execution path by modifying this return address.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4 id="gotchas">Gotchas&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>In some explanations, you may see espmain/StackFramemain in the figure above should also include the parameter being passed to foo. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve excluded it here for the sake of avoiding confusion of overlapping stack frames.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="dynamic-analysis">Dynamic Analysis&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Armed with our static analysis so far, we start our dynamic analysis. So, fire up gdb. We know that &lt;code>main&lt;/code> code is like below:&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>We can see that c runtime (or whatever it is that called the main function even if don&amp;rsquo;t want to get ourselves into what that is) has the base pointer (ebp) as 0xbffff838 and this is preserved at 0xbffff7b8. Then, main updates the current stack pointer (esp) as the new ebp of main. After that, main aligns its esp to 16 byte width, thus wasting 8 bytes and then reserves a further 0x50 (80) bytes for its stack. After all these operations, the salient characteristics of main&amp;rsquo;s stack frame are as below:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Current stack top (esp) is 0xbffff760&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Current base pointer (ebp) is 0xbffff7b8&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Main&amp;rsquo;s calling function&amp;rsquo;s ebp is 0xbffff838 and preserved at 0xbffff7b8&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Main&amp;rsquo;s calling function&amp;rsquo;s return address is saved one word before the ebp (as we know as part of the call instruction of calling program). Thus return address is 0xb7eadc76 as we can see at location 0xbffff7bc (previous_ebp + 0x4 = 0xbffff7b8 + 0x4). This address &lt;code>0xbffff7bc&lt;/code> is the one that we want to overwrite with our intended address of &lt;code>win&lt;/code> function so as to execute that instead of main&amp;rsquo;s caller function.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now, run till the next breakpoint.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">(&lt;/span>gdb&lt;span style="color:#f92672">)&lt;/span> c
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Continuing.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Breakpoint 3, 0x08048418 in main &lt;span style="color:#f92672">(&lt;/span>argc&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>1, argv&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>0xbffff864&lt;span style="color:#f92672">)&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> at stack4/stack4.c:15
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>15 in stack4/stack4.c
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">(&lt;/span>gdb&lt;span style="color:#f92672">)&lt;/span> x $esp
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0xbffff760: 0xbffff770
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">(&lt;/span>gdb&lt;span style="color:#f92672">)&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>So we see that the pointer address for storing the input string from &lt;code>gets&lt;/code> is located at 0xbffff770 (since the argument to &lt;code>gets&lt;/code> is the buffer address and it is passed at the top of the stack as we know from previous section). We can see how far away this is from the address we want to overwrite by subtracting it:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0xbffff7bc - 0xbffff770 &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> 0x4C &lt;span style="color:#f92672">(&lt;/span>or &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">76&lt;/span> bytes&lt;span style="color:#f92672">)&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>So, we know that the difference between our intended location and input buffer address is 76 bytes, so if we input 80 bytes, the 77th-80th bytes will overwrite the return address. We can now go for the win (pun intended) already but let&amp;rsquo;s continue further to our rest of the breakpoints to confirm our theory.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">(&lt;/span>gdb&lt;span style="color:#f92672">)&lt;/span> c

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>

This series is geared towards a structured, but almost completely practical, approach to learn Reverse Engineering. Many of the existing articles/books take a long winded approach to teach RE which is prefixed with a lot of theory before the reader can get their hands dirty. This series will take a different approach of picking up various challenges in the order of increasing difficulty and help the reader in exploring ways how to break them. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to keep mundane theory limited to the portions needed to beat the current challenge in consideration.

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d like to believe that these articles will prove helpful to those who are completely new to the world of reverse engineering. But I hope that even intermediate level readers would be able to make use of these by picking up the articles according to their appropriate levels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pre-requisite for these articles is basic knowledge of programming concepts, prefereably C. Any kind of prior experience with any assembly language is good but not mandatory.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="exploit-exercises--protostar">Exploit Exercises / Protostar&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For the first few articles of this series, we&amp;rsquo;ll work through some of the challenges from &lt;a href="https://exploit-exercises.com">Exploit Exercises&lt;/a>, starting with &lt;a href="https://exploit-exercises.com/protostar/">Protostar&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note that although most of the challenges on exploit exercises provide source code of the challenge, we&amp;rsquo;d try to hack our way using purely reverse engineering as much as possible without looking at the source code. This would lead to better learning and avoid guiding you towards the solution pre-maturely. I strongly recommend that you do not look at the C source unless you&amp;rsquo;ve completed the below artcile fully or are not able to make connection to the assembly code at all after serious effort.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="setup">Setup&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To create the setup, follow the below steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Download the Protostar ISO file from &lt;a href="https://exploit-exercises.com/download/">https://exploit-exercises.com/download/&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Download and install VMWare Workstation Player or VirtualBox&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a new virtual machine in the vm software you downloaded using the nebula ISO from the first step&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The iso is a live CD, so you can boot from it directly, instead of having to install it in the VM&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re all set now to begin&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="stack-0">Stack 0&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://exploit-exercises.com/protostar/stack0/">Stack0&lt;/a> is the first challenge in protostar.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="preparing-for-the-challenge">Preparing for the challenge&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The webpage says that the challenge is located at &lt;code>/opt/protostar/bin/stack0&lt;/code>, so login to the VM and run this program. It looks like it is waiting for some input. On entering any data, it seems to tell us we were wrong with a message &lt;code>Try again?&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>user@protostar:/opt/protostar/bin$ ./stack0
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>asd
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Try again?
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>user@protostar:/opt/protostar/bin$
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>We run &lt;code>strings&lt;/code> command on the stack0 program to find out interesting text present in it, and see another one &lt;code>you have changed the 'modified' variable&lt;/code>, which seems to be our target.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>user@protostar:/opt/protostar/bin$ strings stack0

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>__gmon_start__
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>libc.so.6
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>_IO_stdin_used
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>gets
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>puts
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>__libc_start_main
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>GLIBC_2.0
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>PTRh@
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">[&lt;/span>^_&lt;span style="color:#f92672">]&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>you have changed the &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;modified&amp;#39;&lt;/span> variabley
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Try again?
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>user@protostar:/opt/protostar/bin$
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h3 id="static-analysis">Static Analysis&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Now that we know what we need to achieve, we start our reverse engineering by doing static analysis of the program. There are several utilities to look at the low level code of the program. However, we will be using &lt;code>gdb&lt;/code> here which can help us later in dynamic analysis as well. gdb or The GNU Project Debugger is a popular open source debugger. We&amp;rsquo;ll graduate to more powerful tools or use reverse engineering oriented plugins for gdb later, but for now a vanilla gdb will do. It is already installed in the protostar VM. A debugger allows us to examine the internal state of the program as it executes at instruction/register level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some of the important commands that you&amp;rsquo;d use during the static analysis for this challenge are:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>set disassembly-flavor intel&lt;/code>: While this is optional, but it allows to see the disassembled code in a more readable format.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>disassemble &amp;lt;function&amp;gt;&lt;/code>: This command displays the disassembled code of &lt;code>function&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can read more about these commands at &lt;a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/">https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="http://visualgdb.com/gdbreference/commands/">http://visualgdb.com/gdbreference/commands/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using the above information, we load the &lt;code>stack0&lt;/code> executable in GDB and disassemble the function &lt;code>main&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h4 id="making-sense-of-the-assembly-code">Making sense of the assembly code&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Well, so we got a&amp;hellip;.big pile of gibberish? So, this is how assembly code looks like. Very different from a regular C program, as you can see. On the left side, you can see the memory addresses where a particular instruction is present and on the right side the instruction. Each instruction is again composed of two parts:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The instruction itself&lt;/li>
&lt;li>0 or more operands (which can be addresses or registers with some specific formatting that we will learn as we encounter it)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now, although this is a small enough program, as good reverse engineers, we rarely go through the whole program immediately which would require us to know each assembly instruction as well as take a lot of time. So, instead we will make some intelligent guesses and look at only the instructions/code that we really need to know. Just know these basic things before moving forward:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Any instruction that works on some data either takes one or more addresses and/or registers as operands, which it operates on&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A register like eax is a basically a temporary/scratch memory close to the CPU for getting fast access to a data being used locally frequently&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There are few special registers. For current problem, know that ebp is the Stack Base pointer or the bottom of current stack frame, esp is the stack pointer or the current top of the stack, eip is the instruction pointer or the address of the instruction which is just about to be executed. We&amp;rsquo;ll learn more about the ebp/esp when we do a real stack overflow problem&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A square bracket &lt;code>[]&lt;/code> around a address or register signifies that the instruction refers to the value present in that address/register as the source or destination of the operation instead of the address/register itself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For most operations involving a source and destination operand, the left operand is the destination.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If you face problem in understanding the below information and think you need to understand x86 assembly a bit more before moving forward, you can use this very short and simple guide for the same: &lt;a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs216/guides/x86.html">https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs216/guides/x86.html&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many times, my first intuition is to find out the areas in code which lead to our success/failure cases and work backwards from there. From our preparation phase, we saw that the failure case printed a message &lt;code>Try again?&lt;/code> on the screen and the success case was potentially a message &lt;code>you have changed the 'modified' variable&lt;/code>. Skimming over the code quickly, you will notice 3 peculiar statements that you may already be familiar from your C programming.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0x0804840c &amp;lt;main+24&amp;gt;: call 0x804830c &amp;lt;gets@plt&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>...
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0x08048420 &amp;lt;main+44&amp;gt;: call 0x804832c &amp;lt;puts@plt&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>...
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0x0804842e &amp;lt;main+58&amp;gt;: call 0x804832c &amp;lt;puts@plt&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>If you don&amp;rsquo;t remember what &lt;code>gets&lt;/code> and &lt;code>puts&lt;/code> do, you can look at their descriptions from their manpages (e.g. &lt;code>man puts&lt;/code>). In brief, &lt;code>gets&lt;/code> allows you to capture user input from stdin and &lt;code>puts&lt;/code> allows you to print output to stdout to display to the user. This matches with our observations in the previous section that it waited for user input when we ran the program and gave an error message on receiving the input. We also saw a 2nd string which was potentially the success message. So we have 1 gets and 2 puts statements corresponding to this, but we don&amp;rsquo;t know yet which one of the 2 puts statements is the success part and which one is the failure part.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyways, we start moving a bit backwards from the first puts statement and try to make sense of each instruction:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0x08048420 &amp;lt;main+44&amp;gt;: call 0x804832c &amp;lt;puts@plt&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Here, the &lt;code>call&lt;/code> instruction refers to calling a function specified by the address 0x804832c. The string inside &amp;lt;&amp;gt; is the disassembler telling you the symbol name associated with that address.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0x08048419 &amp;lt;main+37&amp;gt;: mov DWORD PTR &lt;span style="color:#f92672">[&lt;/span>esp&lt;span style="color:#f92672">]&lt;/span>,0x8048500
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Here, the &lt;code>mov&lt;/code> instruction is moving the value 0x8048500 into the address pointed by the register esp. The X86 calling convention puts the arguments to a function onto the stack before calling it and here the esp is the &amp;ldquo;Stack pointer&amp;rdquo; register. So, this must be the address of the string being passed to puts that it must print. Keep this address 0x8048500 in mind for our next section (Dynamic Analysis).&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0x08048411 &amp;lt;main+29&amp;gt;: mov eax,DWORD PTR &lt;span style="color:#f92672">[&lt;/span>esp+0x5c&lt;span style="color:#f92672">]&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0x08048415 &amp;lt;main+33&amp;gt;: test eax,eax
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0x08048417 &amp;lt;main+35&amp;gt;: je 0x8048427 &amp;lt;main+51&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Here we see that first we move some data from the address esp + 0x5c into eax. then the &lt;code>test&lt;/code> instruction checks whether eax is zero or not. It does this by AND&amp;rsquo;ing the left and right operand. Since eax is the left as well as the right operand, the AND result will be zero only if eax is zero. Then the &lt;code>je&lt;/code> (or jump if equal to) instruction will jump the program execution to the address 0x8048427 (i.e. it will skip the first puts statement and start executing near our 2nd puts statement) if eax was zero. Otherwise it will execute the first puts statement. It decides the &amp;ldquo;equal to&amp;rdquo; condition by looking at an internal flag called Zero Flag (or Z or ZF) and treats equals condition to be true if this flag is set. This is because a &lt;code>test&lt;/code> or a &lt;code>cmp&lt;/code> (compare) instruction will set the ZF to 1 if result of the AND of 2 operands (in case of test) or difference of 2 operands (in case of cmp) was 0.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This seems like our decision maker code as if we can manipulate the value at [esp+0x5c] then we can control the flow of the program to either of the puts statements. So, let&amp;rsquo;s keep this address in mind for our dynamic analysis.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0x08048405 &amp;lt;main+17&amp;gt;: lea eax,&lt;span style="color:#f92672">[&lt;/span>esp+0x1c&lt;span style="color:#f92672">]&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0x08048409 &amp;lt;main+21&amp;gt;: mov DWORD PTR &lt;span style="color:#f92672">[&lt;/span>esp&lt;span style="color:#f92672">]&lt;/span>,eax
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0x0804840c &amp;lt;main+24&amp;gt;: call 0x804830c &amp;lt;gets@plt&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Finally we reach the user input call. &lt;code>lea&lt;/code> instruction means &amp;ldquo;Load effective address&amp;rdquo;. It is a slightly tricky instruction in the sense that:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>it does the calculations only on the right side operand, not both and then stores the result in left operand&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the square brackets [] don&amp;rsquo;t really refer to the meaning that we know from other instructions (i.e. you dont need to find out further the value present at calculated address and can just ignore the [])&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Combining this knowledge with the semantics of mov/call that we learnt earlier, we know that the program is collecting the user input and storing that into a location starting at esp+0x1c.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0x080483fd &amp;lt;main+9&amp;gt;: mov DWORD PTR &lt;span style="color:#f92672">[&lt;/span>esp+0x5c&lt;span style="color:#f92672">]&lt;/span>,0x0
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>And then we come to this instruction which looks a bit familiar to us because we&amp;rsquo;ve already seen that address esp+0x5c earlier. So, this seems like the initialization statement for a variable which is set to 0 and then later checked whether it is still 0 or not.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-vulnerability">The vulnerability&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Our task then is to make this variable (at location esp+0x5c) 0 or non-zero depending on what do the 2 puts statements do. The only access to influence the program we have is through the input we can give to &lt;code>gets&lt;/code>. Hmm, so we dig deeper into the gets manpage and we see below:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>gets() reads a line from stdin into the buffer pointed to by s until either a terminating newline or EOF, which it replaces with a null byte (&amp;#39;\0&amp;#39;). No check for buffer overrun is performed (see BUGS below).
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Great! So we know that we need to update a value at address esp+0x5c and we know that we have a possibility to have unchecked writes done starting from esp+0x1c. You know where this is going, and we almost don&amp;rsquo;t even need further dynamic analysis to crack this now. But I&amp;rsquo;ll take you through a bit of dynamic analysis for a brief introduction to it and for confirming our theory.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="dynamic-analysis">Dynamic Analysis&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>While in static analysis we carry out all our inspections without running the program, in dynamic analysis we monitor the internal state of the program while it is running. For this, we will run the program inside gdb. You should know the following basic commands for this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>r&lt;/code>: Run the currently loaded program from beginning&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>b *&amp;lt;address&amp;gt;&lt;/code>: Put a breakpoint at &amp;lt;address&amp;gt; so that the program stops execution when it reaches that address.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>c&lt;/code>: Continue execution&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>info r&lt;/code>: This displays the current state of the CPU&amp;rsquo;s general purpose registers&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>x/&amp;lt;n&amp;gt;&amp;lt;s&amp;gt; &amp;lt;address/register&amp;gt;&lt;/code>: This allows to examine the process memory at the given address or address contained in register. You can use various switches &amp;lt;s&amp;gt; with it to display a specific amount of memory and in a specific format. e.g., /i displays the memory as instructions, /x as hex, /s as strings, etc. The number &amp;lt;n&amp;gt; is used to display n units of memory&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, before we run the program, recall that we had 2 puts calls in our assembly code and we didn&amp;rsquo;t know which one was the success case and which was failure. So we simply try to read the strings present at the addresses which were passed to the puts calls.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">(&lt;/span>gdb&lt;span style="color:#f92672">)&lt;/span> x/s 0x8048500
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0x8048500: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;you have changed the &amp;#39;modified&amp;#39; variable&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">(&lt;/span>gdb&lt;span style="color:#f92672">)&lt;/span> x/s 0x8048529
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0x8048529: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;Try again?&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">(&lt;/span>gdb&lt;span style="color:#f92672">)&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>So we knnow that our first puts call is the success case and the second one is failure. Now, our observation was that if the value at esp+0x5c was 0, then it goes to the second puts call and otherwise it goes to first. So, we have to somehow make this value non-zero to get success.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We know that our area of interest is in the gets call through which we can manipulate the program memory. So let&amp;rsquo;s put couple of breakpoints, 1 before gets and 1 after and then run the program.&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>We entered &lt;code>AAAAAAAAAAAA&lt;/code> as the input, i.e., 12 &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; characters as input and notice that 12 bytes starting from 0xbffff76c onwards now reflect as 0x41 (which is the &lt;a href="http://www.asciitable.com/">ascii value&lt;/a> of A). So if we enter more number of As, we can continue overwriting more memory locations with 0x41 till we reach esp+0x5c. We can find the distance between the input variable and output variable addresses by doing this simple calculation of (esp+0x5c - esp+0x1c) or (0xbffff7ac - 0xbffff76c) which comes out to be 0x40 or 64. So, we need to input more than 64 As into the program to modify the variable and get the desired result.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Try this out now on regular command line:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>So, in this article, we learnt:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>About a very basic buffer overflow on the stack and how to exploit it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Static and dynamic analysis portions of reverse engineering&lt;/li>
&lt;li>strings command&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Introduction to x86 assembly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Several gdb commands&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We also learnt that usage of &lt;code>gets&lt;/code> function is very dangerous as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any kind of check on the amount of input coming from the user versus the space we have to save it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

This is a post to explain what/why/how about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-my-own-shorturl-website">Why my own shorturl website?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>So far I had been using sites like bit.ly or TinyURL whenever I needed to generate a shorturl (e.g. for giving to someone for easily remember, noting down on paper, putting links on resume, etc) but I had concerns that:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The site could go out of operation anytime.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They seem a bit unprofessional and also, there are a lot of scammy links floating around on these sites that many folks are wary of clicking on them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I lose the SEO juice to external sites&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Custom shorturl keywords were mostly taken&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Keep history of all links I convert&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I could satisfy a few of these points by creating an account and using my custom domain with bit.ly or something but my developer itch sealed the deal by giving me something to code :P.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="requirements-for-the-shorturl-website">Requirements for the shorturl website&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>These were the requirements that I listed out while beginning the project:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Should be cheap af. (I ended up at FREE! ;) )&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Should be maintenance free and run itself (I didn&amp;rsquo;t want another headache to tune/apply patches for and what not)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Should allow addition of links from anywhere (whether on my PC or not)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Should allow random links as well as custom ones&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Should allow to remove previously generated shorturls&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Should allow me to easily see all generated shorturls, preferably along with history&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Allow previewing the link a shorturl points to without redirecting, if needed&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These lead me to decide on a couple of important things:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The site had to be static (Host on s3 for cheap or github pages for free. No patches/maintenance. Super performance)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Had to be version controlled (Easy history/viewing/editing from anywhere.)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="deecubes">deecubes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Thus, &lt;a href="https://shgl.in/deecubes/">deecubes&lt;/a> was born. (The link in the previous line is shortened using deecubes itself, by the way)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The name comes from the short form &amp;lsquo;DSSS&amp;rsquo; of Damn Simple Static url Shortener (so, a D and a cube of S&amp;rsquo;s. Idiotic, I know). You can read more about how to use it at the above link in the README but in summary:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s written in pure python&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It takes a long form url and creates a static website shorturl that can be auto-generated or custom&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s deterministic, so you can be sure of generating the same website from the same inputs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Preview can be seen at &lt;code>&amp;lt;shorturl&amp;gt;/preview.html&lt;/code> (e.g. &lt;a href="https://shgl.in/deecubes/preview.html">https://shgl.in/deecubes/preview.html&lt;/a> )&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Published on pypi, so can install with pip&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Several ways to use/deploy (as simple as ftp or bash/batch scripts or manual git commits/push or commit directly through github website etc )&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Take a look at my generated website repository as an example at &lt;a href="https://shgl.in/deecubesdemo">deecubesdemo&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="my-deployment-strategy">My deployment strategy&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I ended up with the following stack to add links rather painlessly from anywhere and not do any maintenance:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Github for hosting the website using github pages&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cloudflare to provide that shiny https and some statistics/caching etc&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Travis to automatically build and deploy the site so I dont need to always generate the shorturl and can commit from anywhere&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Check the repository I linked above to see how it is done. Most of the magic is done in a few lines of the &lt;a href="https://shgl.in/11PAfL1QG/">.travis.yml&lt;/a> file. Essentially it follows this path:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I commit a shorturl .txt file directly in the &amp;ldquo;raw&amp;rdquo; directory through github web on &amp;ldquo;source&amp;rdquo; branch&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Travis picks up the commit and runs deecubes&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;sync&amp;rdquo; command to generate the website portions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Travis deploys the &amp;ldquo;output&amp;rdquo; folder contents to the &amp;ldquo;master&amp;rdquo; branch of the same repo.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Github is configured to serve the website from &amp;ldquo;docs&amp;rdquo; folder of master branch through my custom domain shgl.in (&amp;ldquo;docs&amp;rdquo; folder is already created and checked-in inside output folder along with CNAME file)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cloudflare is configured to redirect all requests to shgl.in to my github repo&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In a more traditional way, I could also do this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Generate a shorturl locally using an &amp;ldquo;add&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;generate&amp;rdquo; command. You could be done at this point and publish the output folder to your website any way you want.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I Commit the generated files including the output into the repo and push to github.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Travis will still run and publish the website as earlier.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="things-to-come">Things to come?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I want to add the following things in next few weeks to the project:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A collision handling mechanism which is also deterministic&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Allow google analytics addition for collecting metrics&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Allow custom templates for redirect and preview urls&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your suggestions?&lt;/li>

You install it from github or from pypi.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="email-actions">email-actions&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>email-actions is a tiny SMTP server with a rules based engine to trigger any actions (notifications/commands etc) based on the emails sent to this server.
Think of it like &lt;a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT&lt;/a> but where input trigger is email and can be set up and run locally as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="why-did-you-make-email-actions">Why did you make email-actions&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Like most of my projects, email-actions is a &amp;lsquo;scratch-your-own-itch&amp;rsquo; project. I bought a NAS (Synology ds216j) which also doubled as a downloader of anime/tv shows etc through RSS using its inbuilt &amp;ldquo;Download Station&amp;rdquo; app. I also used Plex to watch them over the network but these needed to be moved to a proper folder and named in a specific format (and some crap deleted and other maintenance done or sometimes some post processing done) to have Plex display/play them properly. I used Filebot and a few custom scripts for this but had to either do this manually or use a fixed time task scheduling (which tended to delay watching). This was semi-irritating.
I also wanted to know when something had been downloaded so I could binge on that latest episode as soon as it was done :)
Download station had a hack (by changing internal files) to run custom script after a download was completed but it had to be redone after every firmware update and sometimes, after every restart. And finally it stopped working altogether with recent updates.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>Releasing my project &lt;a href="https://github.com/shantanugoel/email-actions">email-actions&lt;/a> today.

&lt;p>It did support email notifications though. Thus email-actions was born. So I could push notifications for downloaded items run my custom scripts on the downloaded items.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve started using it for many other things as email is pervasive and most of the devices support email based notifications. So I can trap them and carry out other actions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="what-are-the-benefitsdifferences-compared-to-hosted-services-like-ifttt">What are the benefits/differences compared to hosted services like IFTTT&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>IFTTT provides email hooks as well. I &lt;em>think&lt;/em> email-actions may be an alternative (you can decide whether it&amp;rsquo;s better or not) with respect to below:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>IFTTT works as a client once email is received so you still need an available SMTP server to be able to send email. This can be expensive or risky as you&amp;rsquo;d have to share your server username/pwd to the email sending entity. email-actions is an SMTP server that takes actions before any actual email delivery.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Can be run locally with minimal dependencies. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to send your data to internet or even have an internet connection&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tiny footprint&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Can run local commands as well while IFTTT still needs to be integrated with something else if that&amp;rsquo;s what you need&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You are in control of your info&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Free(er), that is, no limitations on hooks/conditions etc&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="current-high-level-feature-list">Current high level feature list&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>aiosmtpd based for aync email processing for performance&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The action execution is also asyncio based, so will free up the email sender while processing the action in background&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Easy yaml based configuration&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Global or local variables for full customization/reuse&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Action decision based on &amp;ldquo;To&amp;rdquo; email address filtering (Addition of many other filters on the roadmap)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Plugins supported:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://joaoapps.com/join/">Join&lt;/a> push notifications (Will add pushbullet if there&amp;rsquo;s a demand or can use custom external script for now)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Custom Local commands (Any arguments, any script type, custom environment variables)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Email (Can forward the email to custom upstream servers further if needed for more actions or actual email delivery)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="installation">Installation&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Pre-requisites: You need Python 3.4+ to be able to run this&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Install using pip (May need to use &lt;code>pip3&lt;/code> instead of &lt;code>pip&lt;/code> according to your OS/python installation. May need to use &lt;code>sudo&lt;/code> prefix before below command if installing system wide)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;code>pip install email-actions&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Install directly&lt;/li>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Specify config file (yaml format) to be used. If it
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> doesn&amp;#39;t exist, we&amp;#39;ll try to create it
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Examples:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>email_actions -H 127.0.0.1 -p 8500 -l 2 -c /home/shantanu/email_actions_cfg.yml
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>email_actions -c /home/shantanu/email_actions_cfg.yml
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Most of the options above are self explanatory. If you don&amp;rsquo;t specify a hostname, it will choose &lt;code>localhost&lt;/code> by default. If you don&amp;rsquo;t specify a port, it&amp;rsquo;ll choose &lt;code>8025&lt;/code> by default.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note&lt;/strong> I recommend running the server on localhost or an internal network interface so that it can&amp;rsquo;t be abused from internet. Right now it doesn&amp;rsquo;t support authentication (limitation of aiosmtpd. Will be fixed soon), so if you must open it up to the internet, add your own scheme of verification either through a randomly generated email address in &amp;ldquo;To&amp;rdquo; rule or some other check in subject/content in your own external script that you are triggering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Specifying a config file is mandatory. If the specified file doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist, we&amp;rsquo;ll generate a dummy one which you can fill. But essentially this is a step that you can&amp;rsquo;t avoid. The config file is explained in more detail below.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="config-file-format">Config file format&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>email-actions uses the simple &lt;code>yaml&lt;/code> format for its configuration. Learning this is a small task (few minutes at most for the basic usage that we need). You can look at &lt;a href="https://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/yaml">this page&lt;/a> for a quick reference.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>email-actions works on the basis of user specified &lt;code>filters&lt;/code>. Each filter can have &lt;code>rules&lt;/code> specified which decide whether to run an action or not on the incoming email. Each filter also specifies &lt;code>actions&lt;/code> (which is 1 or more plugins) to run an action on the incoming email if it passes the &lt;code>rules&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At least 1 filter is necessary in the configuration. Each filter must have at least 1 action. Rest all is optional. Each action plugin may have it&amp;rsquo;s own mandatory OR optional settings. See &lt;a href="#plugin-settings">Plugin Settings&lt;/a> for all available plugins and their options/variables&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The config file has the following general format. All text after &lt;code>#&lt;/code> is an explanation, not a part of the config itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Names within &lt;code>&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code> can be substituted by user as per their choice. Names outside &lt;code>&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code> are reserved by email-actions and must be used as is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All settings are case-sensitive. So take care of that.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Feel free to fork the repo and send PRs for any changes. If you can&amp;rsquo;t make changes but want to report issues or provide feedback, open an Issue on github or ping me on twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/shantanugoel">@shantanugoel&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can contribute either to the core or write a plugin for your usecase. The only guiding principle is to keep it as simple/minimal as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-write-a-plugin">How to write a plugin&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Take a look at any plugin in &lt;a href="https://github.com/shantanugoel/email-actions/tree/master/email_actions/plugins">plugins&lt;/a> directory
A minimal plugin needs to do following things:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Define &amp;lsquo;PLUGIN_NAME&amp;rsquo;. This need not be same as the file name but is preferred to keep that way&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A function that takes these parameters: &lt;code>filter_name, msg_from, msg_to, msg_subject, msg_content&lt;/code> and doesn&amp;rsquo;t return anything&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Read plugin&amp;rsquo;s configuration (if any) using email_actions.config.read_config_plugin function
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Ideally the plugin should not need to use any other function from the core&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After writing the plugin, add the plugin&amp;rsquo;s name and entry function in &lt;code>entry_funcs&lt;/code> dict in &lt;a href="https://github.com/shantanugoel/email-actions/tree/master/email_actions/plugins/__init__.py">plugins init file&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;p>We talked earlier about how certain &lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/2016/09/17/indian-isp-act-fibernet-blocks-bit-ly-does-dns-hijacking/">ISPs block websites by using DNS hijack methods&lt;/a> and I had recommended using DNSCrypt to bypass it. Well, as part of my home network overhaul, I moved over from the consumer grade (but still decent enough) Asus router over to Ubiquiti stack which, among other things, lead me to use their &amp;ldquo;Unify Security Gateway (USG)&amp;rdquo; as the router. Now, this router is pretty decent and is running Ubiquiti&amp;rsquo;s EdgeOS (derived from Vyatta OS, which in turn is based on linux/debian). You can install and tweak a lot of stuff through command line if you&amp;rsquo;d like but alas there&amp;rsquo;s no dnscrypt-proxy available for it.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;h2 id="the-background">The Background&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We talked earlier about how certain &lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/2016/09/17/indian-isp-act-fibernet-blocks-bit-ly-does-dns-hijacking/">ISPs block websites by using DNS hijack methods&lt;/a> and I had recommended using DNSCrypt to bypass it. Well, as part of my home network overhaul, I moved over from the consumer grade (but still decent enough) Asus router over to Ubiquiti stack which, among other things, lead me to use their &amp;ldquo;Unify Security Gateway (USG)&amp;rdquo; as the router. Now, this router is pretty decent and is running Ubiquiti&amp;rsquo;s EdgeOS (derived from Vyatta OS, which in turn is based on linux/debian). You can install and tweak a lot of stuff through command line if you&amp;rsquo;d like but alas there&amp;rsquo;s no dnscrypt-proxy available for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had the below options now to overcome my ISP&amp;rsquo;s DNS hijacking:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Compile dnscrypt manually and use it&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Run dnscrypt on another server/device internally (maybe my NAS or the ubiquiti cloudkey or something)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Use one of the other options I had originally discussed (hosts file, VPN, alternate port)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I rejected the first option as it meant setting up a cross compilation environment just for one program and also it may be hard to keep up in future. The 2nd option wasn&amp;rsquo;t too good either as I didn&amp;rsquo;t want my network infrastructure&amp;rsquo;s basic need of DNS to depend on another device which may not be as resilient due to other regular use. From the other earlier discussed alternatives, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to do the manual upkeep of hosts file or fall into the expensive/slow/insecure trap of VPNs. So I settled on the next best solution of using an alternate port for my DNS queries, with the hope that the ISP is dumb (or cost conscious) enough to rely only on port number to higjack DNS and not use DPI for it (even though &lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/2017/01/24/act-fibernet-deep-packet-inspection-blocking-sites/">they do use DPI for at least some types of blocking&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="testing-the-waters">Testing the Waters&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First thing was to try whether this would even work or not. So I tried it easily by querying for a blocked torrent site first through ISP&amp;rsquo;s DNS servers, then OpenDNS servers on default DNS port (53) and then Open DNS servers on port 5353 (Yes, OpenDNS responds to dns queries on 5353 as well, fortunately.)&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="left" >
&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/2017/03/dns-queries-thumb.jpg" />
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>In the first 2 attempts, the IP returned was my ISP&amp;rsquo;s hijacked reply (pointing to their own generic server that they use to respond to blocked site requests) but in the last one (using port 5353), the DNS request went unmodified and came back with the real IP of the website. Success!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="configuring-the-usg">Configuring the USG&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>So, on to the real deal. USG does have a UI option in the Unify Controller software to set custom DNS servers. However, it takes only IPs and not ports. This is understandable as I found out after going through resolv.conf manpages and several old discussions. resolv.conf&amp;rsquo;s support for alternate ports has been discussed several times and rejected in favor of other system wide solutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had a thought to use iptables to forward all requests going out to WAN port 53 to port 5353. But, this is like using a shotgun to pop balloons. Firewall solutions like this should be used rarely as they strain the traffic processing as they build up quickly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>USG uses dnsmasq though, so there was hope. DNSmasq allows to set ports as well for nameservers as per its manpage. So, the problem statement was thus as below:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t use resolv.conf at all (to avoid ISP&amp;rsquo;s DNS servers or any other DNS servers leaking traffic onto port 53)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Set OpenDNS nameserver ip/port in dnsmasq for all sites (Generally folks use it for specific sites, but the configuration syntax is flexible enough to mould it anyways and we can set it as a generic server too)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s no UI option for this though, so you&amp;rsquo;ve to drop down to the CLI. Launch an ssh session to the USG ip and use the credentials that you&amp;rsquo;ve set in the unify controller to log in. Then run the below set of commands. The procedure is slightly different from a regular linux box (where you&amp;rsquo;d directly edit dnsmasq.conf) due to the specific nature of config management of ubiquiti devices.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span># Switch to configuration mode
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$ configure
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span># Below commands will generate the appropriate dnsmasq.conf automaticall
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span># Don&amp;#39;t use resolve.conf
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$ set service dns forwarding options &amp;#34;no-resolv&amp;#34;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span># Set the opendns nameserver for all sites
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$ set service dns forwarding options &amp;#34;server=208.67.222.222#5353&amp;#34;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span># Generate the config files, save and exit
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$ commit;save;exit
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now, you can try browsing (or doing nslookup) for the blocked website and it&amp;rsquo;ll go through succesfully. Note that like all other CLI changes for USG, the above changes can be lost whenever you make some other config change through UI or update USG firmware. To make it persistent across such events, you need to follow the &lt;a href="https://help.ubnt.com/hc/en-us/articles/215458888-UniFi-How-to-further-customize-USG-configuration-with-config-gateway-json">config.gateway json process&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>ACT Fibernet blocks sites using deep packet inspection</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2017/01/24/act-fibernet-deep-packet-inspection-blocking-sites/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jan 2017 16:04:28 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2017/01/24/act-fibernet-deep-packet-inspection-blocking-sites/</guid><description>&lt;p>ISPs in India have been blocking websites since many years.

&lt;p>A few days ago, there were a few tweets mentioning that &lt;a href="streamable.com">Streamable&lt;/a> was blocked by few Indian ISPs. While checking it out, I noticed that I was not able to access it either on ACT ISP. I tried pinging the site and a traceroute to it and it seemed to work fine with no anomalies which puzzled me. Then I tried using https to access the site, and it opened up fine. This meant that ACT isn&amp;rsquo;t blocking the access based on the dns but by looking at something in my packets and so using https bypassed it (due to encryption of the data lying within).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I further tried doing the same through curl and found that if I fake the &amp;ldquo;Host&amp;rdquo; header in the command, I could access streamable.com even through http. A few other tests confirmed that ACT actually does a partial match for the blocked site because it blocked host headers like fakestreamable.com or streamable.com.in etc as well. But using something like &amp;ldquo;fake.com&amp;rdquo; worked. You can try this with below command and vary the site name after &amp;ldquo;Host:&amp;rdquo; in the command.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>curl -L -g -4 -v --header &amp;quot;Host: streamable.com&amp;quot; streamable.com&lt;/code>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>TLDR;&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Indian ISP ACT Fibernet (aka Beam Telecom) hijacks its users&amp;rsquo; DNS requests (even when using public DNS servers like Google or OpenDNS) and blocks websites through this method. This has huge implications beyond website blocking and you can&amp;rsquo;t rely on anything that you are browsing anymore though there are ways available to make yourself safe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Aside: Indian ISPs are blocking benign/collateral damage sites now like bit.ly for ACT and behance.net for Airtel. Pretty soon most of web will be blocked in India at this rate.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;h2 id="hahahugoshortcode271s0hbhb">

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update:&lt;/strong> It seems that some folks on ACT do not see the block/DNS hijack. So far, they all seem to be on dynamic IP. It could be either that the hijacking is being done only for static IP folks or for specific IP ranges. Please comment here or tweet to me @shantanugoel if you are on ACT but do not see the block and/or dns hijack.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update 2:&lt;/strong> Got a call from ACT team and they&amp;rsquo;ve unblocked bit.ly this morning. However, DNS hijacking, the primary problem, still seems to be there for many users.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="something-bigger-than-blocking">Something bigger than blocking&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>But the rage didn&amp;rsquo;t stop at this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I tried the usual way of adding &amp;ldquo;https&amp;rdquo; to bypass the block but it was highly unusual to see another error which said bit.ly closed my connection. I was sure bit.ly supports https as I could see on my Airtel connection. So this was weird.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="left" >
&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/2016/09/Selection_056-300x160.png" />
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I tried a simple ping to bit.ly and well well well! It turns out, I am not even connecting to bit.ly at all but one of the servers of my ISP itself. The other sites like google.com were being resolved correctly.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet">&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr">Well, I&amp;#39;ll be damned :o bit.ly is pointing to &lt;a href="https://t.co/Yp6tdKp23o">https://t.co/Yp6tdKp23o&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/thTD2dvEv3">pic.twitter.com/thTD2dvEv3&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&amp;mdash; Shantanu Goel (@shantanugoel) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/shantanugoel/status/777081685305270272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 17, 2016&lt;/a>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>This &amp;ldquo;might&amp;rdquo; have been okay/explained away if I was using my ISP&amp;rsquo;s DNS servers (even though it&amp;rsquo;d be unethical in my book even then). But I was NOT using ISP&amp;rsquo;s DNS servers in the first place (who does that, seriously?).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was using google&amp;rsquo;s public DNS servers at my router as well as PC level and resolve.conf is set to use localhost. So I was pretty sure I am using the google dns and I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have got a fake IP back. &lt;strong>This was an even bigger red flag!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I ran the nslookup on bit.ly through an online service and it gave me the correct bit.ly server IPs but running nslookup on my PC or even on my router gave me back the fake IP.

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>This is how (bad) ISPs do this. They look for all traffic on port 53 (the DNS port) and don&amp;rsquo;t let them go to the actual DNS server and fulfill it from their own DNS servers, thus forcing you to go to a location of their bidding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my case, I tried running the various &amp;ldquo;DNS leak tests&amp;rdquo;/&amp;ldquo;Transparent Proxy detection&amp;rdquo; tests but they all came out fine. Because my ISP is doing something clever here. I am assuming that they look at all the addresses that you are trying to reach, and then serve the ones they are interested in from their servers while passing on the rest of the requests to your originally intended dns server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How these tests work is that they see your IP, then ask your browser to connect to some specific server (like 7325abcd.mydnsleaktest.com) and see the IP which is actually touching their dns servers to query that address. I looked at these results and they all showed google to be the one connecting to them and so that seemed fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Luckily, my ISP is not doing this (cannot do this?) for the opendns test and it detected the proxying immediately.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="implicationshow-to-protect-yourself">Implications/How to protect yourself&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The situation is grim now because your ISP can control everything you visit on the internet and you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even know. You could be sending all your searches to your ISP, giving your passwords to them through fake sites, or they could silently replace the script/css etc servers and track all of your behavior, the implications are endless.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But all is not lost. There are a few ways to protect yourself from this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Add the IP manually to your hosts file&lt;/strong>: (H/T https://twitter.com/electron0zero). This is the simplest way as it will bypass even connecting to DNS server at all. But is cumbersome as you have to manually add each site and also update it if the IP changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Get a VPN.&lt;/strong> I prefer this the least though because it is expensive, slow, and in general problematic to setup everywhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>**Reroute your DNS requests to some other non-standard port. **You will need to have a bit of iptables know-how for this and a router good enough to give you this access. But your ISP can&amp;rsquo;t (?) monitor every port for DNS traffic. Theoretically they could though.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Use DNSCrypt&lt;/strong>. This is my recommended method and what I chose to save myself. This is good in future as well to save you from other DNS attacks. From DNScrypt.org&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>DNSCrypt is a protocol that authenticates communications between a DNS client and a DNS resolver. It prevents DNS spoofing. It uses cryptographic signatures to verify that responses originate from the chosen DNS resolver and haven&amp;rsquo;t been tampered with.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Depending on your machines/routers, it can range from easy to difficult. On my Asus RT-N66U with custom firmware, all it took was one line of opkg command to install it and another few lines to start it up at boot and configure dnsmasq to use it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="closing">Closing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not closed yet. I am talking to my ISP to figure this out and see if they will accept removing this kind of malpractice (I don&amp;rsquo;t think they will. But one has to try!). Please do share this to raise awareness. If you have any queries or any other information about this, please do get in touch with me on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/shantanugoel">@shantanugoel&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As an aside, this also means that there is an order out to block bit.ly as well and other ISPs may follow suite soon :|&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Fixing the problem of matplotlib and ggplot not showing graphs in python</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2016/06/29/fixing-the-problem-of-matplotlib-and-ggplot-not-showing-graphs-in-python/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jun 2016 14:20:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2016/06/29/fixing-the-problem-of-matplotlib-and-ggplot-not-showing-graphs-in-python/</guid><description>&lt;p>While trying to make some graphs for one of my side projects recently, I came across an issue that both matplotlib and ggplot did not show up the graphs.

I was able to save the graphs to an image file just fine, but if I tried to show them directly on screen while running the script, it just printed a number and exited. After tearing apart my hair for some time, I checked the backend being used by matplot lib:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>import matplotlib matplotlib.get_backend() &lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And there was the problem. It showed the backend being used was &amp;ldquo;agg&amp;rdquo;. Looking at the matplotlib documentation, I figured that this backend is used for rendering the graph into an image and saving it. That explained why I was able to save the images fine. But it didn&amp;rsquo;t have any interactive support. For that I had to install one of the other backends which had this support, e.g., Tkagg. So, for that what I had to do was, first install the Tk related packages using the below command:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>sudo apt-get install tcl-dev tk-dev python-tk python3-tk &lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another important step now is to reinstall matplotlib so that it detects the new backend, but also remember that if you just do a plain pip uninstall/install, it may not work because that will pick up the previous cached installation. So you have to use the &amp;ndash;no-cache-dir option like below:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>pip uninstall matplotlib pip install matplotlib --no-cache-dir &lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, the graphs work fine for both saving as image as well as showing up during runtime.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>NTP Driver For ESP8266</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2015/03/01/ntp-driver-for-esp8266/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2015 08:02:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2015/03/01/ntp-driver-for-esp8266/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m building a smartwatch project based around the new IoT posterkid on the block, ESP8266.

Slacker has a radio station caching feature but unfortunately doesn&amp;rsquo;t support India. So I took things into my own hands and Shoutcast2Dropbox was born this weekend. Details follow below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Link: &lt;a href="https://github.com/shantanugoel/Shoutcast2Dropbox">https://github.com/shantanugoel/Shoutcast2Dropbox&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="shoutcast2dropbox---automatic-shoutcast-stations-to-dropbox-recorder">&lt;strong>Shoutcast2Dropbox - Automatic Shoutcast Stations To Dropbox Recorder&lt;/strong>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This simple script allows to automatically download a specified duration of song collections from different shoutcast stations and then automatically upload them to your dropbox. This can be used to create your own station caching feature with a variety of benefits:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Individual songs instead of one lengthy stream so you can skip forward/backwards among them&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mix up a variety of different stations instead of listening to a single type (e.g. I mix up different types of rock and metal stations with a few latest hits ones thrown in)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No buffering/precious mobile data usage as the Dropbox folder can be synced to phone on wifi (I use Dropsync to schedule syncs on home wifi)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>New playlist every day instead of listening to same old stored songs&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I created this for myself one day as I was sick of the many issues that plague streaming music (the ones listed above that are overcome with this script). It may have bugs or may not cover all usecases. I&amp;rsquo;d love to get feedback to fix the bugs and add more features, so feel free to send in your requests.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="dependencies">&lt;strong>Dependencies&lt;/strong>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>For the script:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Linux Host - (PC/Router/Raspberry Pi/Server etc). Script is written for shell currently but may be adapted for windows. I run it on my router as a cronjob.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>streamripper - Opensource Shoutcast recorder program&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dropbox Uploader - For Dropbox sync. Linked as submodule in this git repository.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h1 id="usage">&lt;strong>Usage&lt;/strong>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Once above dependencies are satisfied, run the Dropbox Uploader script and do the steps as mentioned to create a folder for syncing the songs to your Dropbox.
After that, you can run the Shoutcast2Dropbox script as below:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>./Shoutcast2Dropbox.sh &amp;lt;Input File for station lists&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Cumulative Duration to record in seconds&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Output Directory path&amp;gt; &lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Input file should have 1 station url per line. An example file (stations-example.txt) is given in this repository
Duration in seconds is split up into equal durations for each station. e.g. 3600 seconds (1 hour) given here with a station list of 3 means each station will be recorded for 1200 seconds (or 20 minutes).
Output directory is where the songs will be captured to.
Example:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>./Shoutcast2Dropbox.sh stations-example.txt 3600 /home/Shantanu/songs &lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sync the folder to your phone (See tips section ;) )&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="tips">&lt;strong>Tips&lt;/strong>&lt;/h1>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Station urls are not the website urls. You need to get their actual shoutcast stream urls. If they are not present on the website in plain view, generally you can &amp;ldquo;inspect&amp;rdquo; the web page or view source to find those out.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Use aac streams if possible. They are lower size and higher quality compared to mp3s&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Instead of running the script manually, set it up as a cron job to run automatically. I set it up to run every day around noon (so that songs get downloaded by the time I reach home)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Set it up on a low power device which is always on. e.g. I set it up on my router.
i) I had to install a few extras on my router for this to work (e.g. coreutils-stat pkg from entware). You may need to do so as well
ii) I used -k option in script for Dropbox Uploader due to missing ca certificates. You may either choose to install certificates (not a problem on PC but slightly involved on router) or use -k option wherever dropbox uploader commands are used. Didn&amp;rsquo;t check in the k option to avoid security issues by default.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>For listening to fresh playlists every day while on the road with least effort, setup your phone to automatically sync this. I use &amp;ldquo;DropSync&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Tasker&amp;rdquo; for this. DropSync allows to sync any dropbox folder to the phone and tasker automates this process while taking care of not disturbing your normal phone use. I set it up like this:
a. Setup DropSync to do only manual sync.
b. In Tasker, create a profile with this conditions:
i) An hourly repeating time event from 10 PM to 6 AM
ii) Wifi is connected instead of mobile data
iii) Location context is home (from another of my profiles. You can instead choose to use your specific home wifi ssid in above step)
iv) Phone is getting charged (so that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t lose power in the middle)
c. Profile enter task is setup to check a variable if sync is done or not. If not done, then trigger the sync and then set the sync done variable.
d. Profile exit task is setup to clear the sync done variable for next day.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>HW Used:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Dagu Chassis (Includes motors/tires and the plates)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dagu Pan/Tilt kit (Servos and brackets to mount the camera)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dagu Mini Driver (Arduino clone + Motor driver)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Raspberry Pi (Model B but any could be used)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A netgear ethernet to wifi adapter (Since I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the raspi cam so had to save a USB port and use this instead of USB wifi adapter)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A cheap old USB webcam&lt;/li>
&lt;li>6 AA Cells&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A sony portable charger to power the raspberry pi and wifi adapter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wires/Screws/Spacers/Tools (lots of them)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Features:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Control the car from any browser&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Can control motion as well as camera pan/tilt from browser using virtual joysticks (Requires multitouch to do pan/tilt as second joystick is needed for this)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Streams back video from car camera to the browser&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Can rotate left/right while being completely stationary&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Can have multiple connections to the car (not recommended for controlling)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Uses websockets for control and response is almost instantaneous like regular toy cars.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Responsive touch-anywhere joysticks using virtualjoystick (&lt;a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/virtualjoystick.js">https://github.com/jeromeetienne/virtualjoystick.js&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>HW Setup overview:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Raspberry Pi connects to the USB webcam and Dagu Mini driver through second USB port (for serial comm)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Raspberry Pi powered by micro USB through portable charger&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>DAGU mini driver powered through a 6 AA battery pack (which powers the motors/servos as well)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Servos connected to Digital Pins 2 and 4&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Motors connected to Pins 8-11&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Wifi adapter powered through portable charger and connected to Pi through ethernet port&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SW Setup Overview:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Use any Raspberry Pi software image. I used vanilla raspbian&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Get all my code from my github: &lt;a href="https://github.com/shantanugoel/raspi-car">https://github.com/shantanugoel/raspi-car&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Compile and start mjpg-streamer using mjpg-streamer.sh (Compilation not needed if using my repo as I included a compiled version of mjpg-streamer and needed plugins)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Start websockets and Dagu communication driver back end: controller.py (python controller.py)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Open browser to &lt;code>http://rpi:8090&lt;/code> (or &lt;code>http://&amp;lt;RaspberryPiIPAddress&amp;gt;:8090&lt;/code>) from any device&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Touch anywhere to start controlling the car. Left half of screen corresponds to car movement joystick. Right half of screen corresponds to camera pan/tilt joystick. You can use either one of them or both simultaneously.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Some Important Points:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Found that you can&amp;rsquo;t use standard Servo library along with DC motors as it disables the PWM on pins 9 &amp;amp; 10 as it uses Timer 1 (Should have read the manual in the first place :| )&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Used ServoTimer2 library to avoid this (since it uses timer 2) but it didn&amp;rsquo;t compile. Got it compiling and is added to my github repo as well so you can use it too.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>ServoTimer2 disables use of digital pin 3 for servo. So had to use pin 4 for tilt&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Raspberry Pi has a back power connection somehow through its full USB port :o Avoid this as much as possible and power on the Pi first and then the battery pack on the Dagu mini driver&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The Sony portable charger is pretty nice and the power on/off button actually came in handy though I generally detested it otherwise. This helped in turning off the Pi (CP-F10 L is the model name if you want)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>There is a nice voltage monitor on the Dagu on analog pin 7. This helps in keeping track of the battery levels and can be used to shutdown the car when needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Servos get driven by the USB power as well but motors require battery power for sure&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Patterbuzz enables users to read premium content on their mobile devices and pay for only what they wish to read. So, If you wish to read only a cover story of a magazine, you do not need to buy a magazine for Rs 100/-. Instead,  you can pay Rs 5/- for only the cover story and read it on your iPAD in an rich and interactive way. this means Patterbuzz wants to unbundle content packaging and let users buy what they wish to. Patterbuzz introduces a digital wallet for the users to make purchases easier and in a pare-paid pay as you go model. In short, we want to be iTunes of publishing industry. This is a unique business model and we are the first ones in India (probably the world) to create this kind of platform for premium content publishing on mobile devices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We, at Patterbuzz, believe that there is huge premium quality indian content which is not easily available, especially in magazines and independent publications / writers which goes unnoticed in the whole world due to focus being majorly on US / UK markets. There is sizable indian/asian population outside india who wishes to read the magazines/independent content from India but they can&amp;rsquo;t find it on any platform. Apart from top Tier indian publications, 90% of the rest of indian publishers cannot reach global audience. Hence, with this background patterbuzz was created.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, Patterbuzz is trying to make content easily accessible to users in best way possible on mobile devices because that&amp;rsquo;s where users are reading more. Patterbuzz app does not just publish magazine PDFs like the rest of the world, they enable the regular print magazine content on digital format in an interactive way. And users can buy whatever they like. Patterbuzz is the only platform(as far as we know) offering unbundled content where a user can buy an individual article rather than purchasing an issue or subscribe to whole magazine. He can see a slideshow of images in an article or like, share and rate an article.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a huge roadmap in terms of features and more monetization options. We are looking forward to create a complete new kind of advertising offerings for premium content leveraging offline advertisement sales systems and apps on all other devices in the next 6-8 months timeframe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We already have 7 magazines on board as launch candidates and many other magazines are in pipeline. Our application just released a few days ago on 3rd Dec 2013 and we believe it will be great for us if you can review our app and let the world know if you like it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This mod will bypass the Email app from becoming device admin for your phone and prevent it from setting up any security restrictions on your device including pin/password/remote wipe, etc. There are a couple other such mods but they don&amp;rsquo;t work at all or don&amp;rsquo;t work for Nexus 4 and/or Android 4.3&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instructions for users&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Remove your existing email account from phone and reboot&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Install Xposed installer (from link above)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Install this mod (Download apk from &lt;a href="https://github.com/shantanugoel/ExchangeBypassXposed/blob/master/ExchangeBypassForXposed/ExchangeBypassForXposed.apk">here&lt;/a> )&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enable the mod in xposed (Preferences for other devices/versions coming Soon)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reboot&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add your email account again. This time, it will ask you that the email
might require security restrictions, say yes to it but it will never actually set the restrictions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Done. :)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Instructions for developers&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Read the xda link at the top of this readme and go through basics of xposed development&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Install xposed as an android sdk addon on your system&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Clone this git repo&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Import in Android Studio&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make changes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Build :)&lt;/li>

&lt;p>I had come across this while reverse engineering the DLNA protocol extensions that Samsung had built in their TVs to get subtitles working over DLNA but didn&amp;rsquo;t put much thought into it. Fueled by the new Raspberry Pi I recently acquired (more on this later below), I set out to find out the details of this service and exploit it for my need and a few hours later, samsung-messagebox was born :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can get it from here: &lt;a href="https://github.com/shantanugoel/samsung-messagebox">https://github.com/shantanugoel/samsung-messagebox&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Usage:&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Developed by Shantanu Goel (http://tech.shantanugoel.com/) version 1.0
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Arguments:
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> -i IP, --ip IP Required. IP Address of the TV
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> -m MSG, --msg MSG Required. Message body text to be sent to TV
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> -p PORT, --port PORT Optional. Port on which message should be sent
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> -t TIME, --time TIME Optional. Receive date and time in epoch/unix format
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> -r RECEIVER, --receiver RECEIVER

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve tested it currently with my 2010 C Series TV. Hopefully, it should work with any TV that has this service. If you face any problems then let me know and I can try to add support for your TV.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Raspberry PI:&lt;/strong> So, where does raspberry pi figure in all this? Well, I wanted to display my incoming call/text alerts on my TV. So, I made a small webserver in python that I run on my raspberry pi, listening for some special parameters. Whenever I get a call or SMS, I created a tasker profile to call this server with the call/sms parameters and the server in turn calls the above samsung-messagebox.py script to display the alerts. I&amp;rsquo;m also planning to integrate it with a dropbox based service to put it to more uses. Let me know if you have any ideas in mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some pics of this working:&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s claim to fame being an awesome virtual surround sound headset which also does the double duty of providing game audio as well as voice chat over the same headset. I preferred this over the Sony PS3 Elite headset as the PX5 is more generic and can work across multiple devices since it uses the regular bluetooth for A2DP and voice chat and the wireless transmitter has standard optical/RCA inputs and outputs.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>So I got this beautiful piece of headset a few days ago, called the EarForce PX5 by TurtleBeach.

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>However, there was one issue. Out of the box, the headset produced serious amount of clicks and pops and other static noises. This is because the wireless transmission for this headset is done over 2.4 GHz band which competes with the various wireless devices that I have around the house. Trying various tools like inSSIDer proved useless as the PX5 isn&amp;rsquo;t a WLAN/802.11 connection evne though it uses the same band. Finally after lot of trial and error, I figured out that doing the following things reduced the noise down to a bare minimum (in fact zero):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Use Channel 9 on the wi-fi router for 2.4GHz band with band width being 20MHz&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Keep the transmitter away from PS3&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Keep the transmitter away from the TV (It&amp;rsquo;s surprising how much the EMI emitting from those huge LCDs can affect wireless performance.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now, it&amp;rsquo;s working awesomely and I just had a decent run of the missing link DLC of Deus Ex HR :)&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>The 80 Column Coding Rule</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2013/02/25/the-80-column-coding-rule/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Feb 2013 18:48:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2013/02/25/the-80-column-coding-rule/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve followed the 80 column rule almost always when I code, i.e., I keep a soft limit of keeping my lines of my code limited to 80 characters max. unless breaking up the line really messes up the readability of the code.&lt;/p>

Am I not wasting precious screen real estate by doing this?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, NO. The reason I still do it is I can use that real estate for much better purposes while not breaking a sweat (and my neck) while reading long horizontal lines of code. It is still much easier to keep the code size limited horizontally within your immediate focus of vision and you can use the rest of the horizontal space for things like having a directory tree or a database of tags showing. But I keep these extras ready at the whim of a button (mapped to key combos in vim) and the most I use it for is having two (or more) files open simultaneously in vim splits to make the code easier to understand or even write. Many times, what I am reading/writing needs me to back and forth between a few files and I can keep them all open using the big screens if I limit my horizontal code size in each file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wasn&amp;rsquo;t still able to convince the person of my self-imposed rule but maybe I&amp;rsquo;m wrong? What do you follow?&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Apple, Anti-Malware, Patents</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2013/02/15/apple-anti-malware-patents/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Feb 2013 16:55:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2013/02/15/apple-anti-malware-patents/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently, there has been this trend. Blogs look for patents filed by companies and then report on each of them as if they are second coming of Jesus in technology. Especially if it is Apple who is doing the filings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few days ago, this &lt;a href="http://www.zdnet.com/apples-new-wave-anti-malware-patent-takes-a-leaf-out-of-qubes-book-7000011118/">new patent&lt;/a> showed up about Apple&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;new wave approach to fighting malware&amp;rdquo; with the author giving up half-researched commentary on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was intrigued by this news (if you can call it that), not because it’s something new but instead because process isolation is hardly a new concept. The author mentions &amp;ldquo;Qubes OS&amp;rdquo; as the one to be original inventor before Apple but in fact, it has been used for years (eg chrooting/containers in linux) and more popular recently in Android’s uid based approach. Even Qualcomm (and other SoC vendors) have stuff that helps in this space with Trustzone based isolation between processor entities at hardware level.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>Recently, there has been this trend.

Even Qualcomm (and other SoC vendors) have stuff that helps in this space with Trustzone based isolation between processor entities at hardware level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, I wanted to check out what’s new here (which was not immediately clear and probably no one else tried to see it because the patent link is wrong in the article and it links to some display patent, not the one in question). The correct patent is this: &lt;a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/RE43987.html">http://www.freepatentsonline.com/RE43987.html&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After going through the mangled language that any patent embodies, it is clear that “conceptually” it is similar to what has been done till now, but the approach is different. On the whole, the basic difference seems to be that linux uses chrooting, android uses separate users, Qubes adds a virtualization layer to achieve the above and Apple goes one further (not necessarily better) and makes it real/physical separate processor instead of a virtual one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, I’m still not sold on this and it doesn’t seem foolproof. (I’m not a security expert by any means, so please take the below with a tablespoon full of salt and you are free to add corrections or throw me out the window ;) ) In fact, it doesn’t seem much better than the current system but has an add-on of cost (extra physical processor, dedicated circuitry/components) and losing ease of use. Some points to be noted:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The burden is still mostly on user. The user still needs to keep all his anti-malware programs updated all the time and be alert for each indication on the system and allow/disallow things to happen in system all the time to keep it protected. This approach is not going to save the system in any way if any of the above steps falter. Which is, pretty similar to what we see today.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The approach does not mention aversion of several crucial points:&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>a. If processor P2 itself is compromised by the malware, then it is rendered useless in the scenario where P2 itself is tasked with scanning the memory/files on Memory M2 for malware. It can be made to just report “all clean” by malware as the scanning engine running on P2 is still accessible by network content in the same way it would have been on P1 in a non-dual-processor system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>b. P2 is connected to the video display subsystem and this can be used to malware’s advantage to trick user into clicking on wrong areas or doing wrong things in the same way as it is today&lt;/p>
&lt;p>c. It says keypresses can be encrypted by P1 and decrypted by Network device 190 to allow P2 to not know what was pressed. But this again seems to not require the above approach. First, it requires a special network device now, not a generic one as mentioned in the patent. Second, since the network device itself needs to be configurable now for this, there is another attack vector there. This is, however, somewhat similar to what existing SoC solutions do in mobile space but that is better/feasible because the other end is a software entity and the mechanics of how it works is different.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>d. For online gaming etc, where the influx of data is huge and needs to be processed in real time, P1 takes this data directly from M2 once P2 signals availability. Not sure, how is this different then from having a single processor system without the above isolation?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>e. Several other things which I can keep typing about till my keys wear out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>TL;DR&lt;/strong>: This patent on its own may be a new idea (rather a new twist to an existing concept) but it is hardly something that can be put into practice and maybe the reason why Apple hasn’t actually produced anything with this, yet. It might become better with other ideas coupled (which Apple may have filed separate patents for but are currently unknown).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Aside: Why do patents cite archaic things? Every patent gives examples of some old stuff. E.g. Even though this patent was filed in 2011, it refers to Pentium 4 as an example of processors and Quake 3 Arena as an example of online games?&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Fixing the DS3/Sixaxis Controller Not Working in PSN Store Issue</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2013/01/13/fixing-the-ds3sixaxis-controller-not-working-in-psn-store-issue/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jan 2013 19:55:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2013/01/13/fixing-the-ds3sixaxis-controller-not-working-in-psn-store-issue/</guid><description>&lt;p>So, my wife got me a new slim PS3 today to replace my old YLOD&amp;rsquo;ed phat (Yes, Awesome wife I know. And slim PS3 cuz I hate the looks of the new superslim). But, I digress. The issue at hand is that everything worked fine when I unwrapped it, hooked it up to the power and TV and switched it on. However, once I started the PSN store (or what is now called Sony Entertainment Network Store), nothing worked. I got the main screen/content of the store displayed but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t move around in the store. None of the buttons on the DS3 worked. I hooked up my older sixaxis and still the same. The only thing I could do was to hit the PS button which would bring up a menu from where I could quit the store app and then again everything worked fine once I was out onto XMB or in any game or for any other feature not related to the store.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>So, my wife got me a new slim PS3 today to replace my old YLOD&amp;rsquo;ed phat (Yes, Awesome wife I know.

&lt;p>Using different controllers made sure that it was not a controller issue. I suspected that it could be a bad coding issue on Sony&amp;rsquo;s part where the store is trying to communicate over some ports and the thread blocks on not being able to (since I had the router firewall on and UPnP disabled) making it look like the controller isn&amp;rsquo;t working. So, I turned on UPnP and rebooted the router but still the same issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, ultimately I hit upon the solution by mistake. I kept a button pressed on the controller while the PSN store was starting up and there it was. I could now move around and use the store without any issues. So, that&amp;rsquo;s the solution folks. Just keep a button pressed before starting the store app and keep it pressed till the main screen is fully loaded. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how or why this fixes the problem and I&amp;rsquo;m going to drop a mail to the Sony customer care after writing this blog post. I hope they fix this in the next update.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Odroid U2 Tips: Overscan, emmc Adapter, HDMI-DVI Adapter</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2013/01/12/odroid-u2-tips-overscan-emmc-adapter-hdmi-dvi-adapter/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jan 2013 17:56:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2013/01/12/odroid-u2-tips-overscan-emmc-adapter-hdmi-dvi-adapter/</guid><description>&lt;p>So I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending a few hours on getting my odroid u2 up and running and here are a few tips that I&amp;rsquo;ve come across in the process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Overscan: **&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, many TVs have this issue that they miss out on displaying the corners of the image put out by the Odroid U2. The phenomenon is called overscan. Now, all you have to do is select settings such as &amp;ldquo;Just Scan&amp;rdquo; or similar on your TV that allows your TV to display image coming from U2 as is. This setting is called &amp;ldquo;Screen Fit&amp;rdquo; on Samsung TVs but I found something weird. My TV already had this setting set for the picture mode, but still I had the overscan issue. What I had to do was to switch to another mode and then back to Screen Fit and it started working fine.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>So I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending a few hours on getting my odroid u2 up and running and here are a few tips that I&amp;rsquo;ve come across in the process.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>emmc Adapter:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The emmc adapter that hardkernel/odroid folks send out with the board to use with a microsd card reader doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to work. However, the issue is that it is slightly bigger than a regular microsd and hence doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit properly inside the reader. All I had to do was to file the top edges a bit and then it worked fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>HDMI-DVI Adapter:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently I&amp;rsquo;ve attached it to my old Samsung B2030 monitor. A tip btw for B2030 owners (or anyone else having a monitor with only DVI input and not HDMI). Despite many folks (including hardkernel/odroid guys) saying that HDMI to DVI adapters are not supported and won&amp;rsquo;t work, they do work but the thing is that the monitor should be turned on before turning on the U2 otherwise U2 doesn&amp;rsquo;t output anything over the HDMI and the monitor won&amp;rsquo;t display anything.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Odroid U2 is here</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2013/01/12/odroid-u2-is-here/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jan 2013 17:46:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2013/01/12/odroid-u2-is-here/</guid><description>&lt;p>So, this little baby landed up in my mailbox a couple of days ago :).

Similarly I get up at different times. Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;m not even home and still the profile runs, making me lose sync.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(For the impatient, if you want to use it, I&amp;rsquo;ve uploaded my profiles to &lt;a href="https://github.com/shantanugoel/tasker">my github account&lt;/a>.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, I set up and quick and simple but much better working night mode profile. It consists 3 different profiles actually as listed below:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Night Mode -&amp;gt; This actually turns on the night mode based on a host of different combinations listed later in the post.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Alarm Detection -&amp;gt; Detects when the alarm goes off&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Unlock Detection -&amp;gt; Detects when the phone display is unlocked.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Home Detection -&amp;gt; Detects if I&amp;rsquo;m at home&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The basic premise behind this night mode setup is:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The phone should detect that I&amp;rsquo;m sleeping by taking a combination of following scenarios:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The location should be at home (Done by home detection profile using &amp;ldquo;Cell Near&amp;rdquo;. I use this mostly because it is more accurate than network location and works indoors as well which GPS doesn&amp;rsquo;t do and is very light on battery as well)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Time should be between 11 PM to 7 AM (my likely sleep time)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Display should not have been unlocked in the last 30 minutes (i.e. make sure I&amp;rsquo;m not actively using the phone)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s dark in the room (Make sure that lights are turned off. Need to turn on ambient light sensor to work with screen off in tasker settings for this)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Once all the above conditions are established, my phone is fairly certain by now that I&amp;rsquo;m indeed sleeping :) and turns off auto sync&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The night mode still has to check whether the conditions still exist after every half hour or so (e.g. I might not be sleeping yet but lights turned off to allow my wife to sleep and I didn&amp;rsquo;t fiddle with the phone for some time)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If I unlock the phone any time at night, it should tell my phone immediately that I&amp;rsquo;m not sleeping and it deactivates the night mode (for the next 30 minutes or so when night mode check kicks in again)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>When the alarm goes off, night mode should be stopped since I&amp;rsquo;m obviously awake now&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>There are quite a few other checks and balances incorporated to make sure all these 4 profiles don&amp;rsquo;t go out of sync and also do as less as possible to preserve battery.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Tested this setup for past few weeks and it works pretty well. If you want to use it, I&amp;rsquo;ve uploaded my profiles to &lt;a href="https://github.com/shantanugoel/tasker">my github account&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Improvements/Changes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Exchange sync still bypasses the auto sync turn off settings. So need to either buy &amp;ldquo;Synker&amp;rdquo; to control exchange sync directly or figure out a way to connect droidwall to tasker to cut the internet connection for exchange app.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The home mode xml in the account does not have anything in cell tower locations ;), so you need to open it in tasker and scan for your own cell towers&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I just turn off auto sync for me in night mode (want to receive sounds for other notifications, texts etc), you can edit the profile to suit your other needs&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You can change the timings as well as per your needs&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I have some prints done to a file in these profiles, mainly for debugging. You can remove those once you are certain the setup works well for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>

Now, the problem is that Apple didn&amp;rsquo;t even register this domain. By design? To make sure that it fails?

&lt;p>Anyways, the threat is averted for now because a good natured githubber, &lt;a href="https://github.com/blog/1099-jason-salaz-is-a-githubber">Jason Salaz&lt;/a>, registered the domain name and plastered a pretty generic webpage over there which doesn&amp;rsquo;t do much (except give him a bit of web traffic boost).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the map fiasco and then this, it looks like Apple is indeed slipping up and things are falling through the cracks. Let&amp;rsquo;s see what Tim Cook has to say about this.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>My Android NFC Car BT Audio Setup</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2012/09/30/my-android-nfc-car-bt-audio-setup/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Sep 2012 18:16:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2012/09/30/my-android-nfc-car-bt-audio-setup/</guid><description>&lt;p>So, my Nexus One&amp;rsquo;s battery finally lost its last legs and I picked up a new Galaxy Nexus to replace it (easy choice, since it&amp;rsquo;s a nexus device and Google sells it for a bargain at their play store).

Anyways, I drift. In the mood to try out the NFC capbilities of my newly acquired gadget I thought of doing something about my car audio setup (previously consisting of a stereo line connecting the aux port of the stereo to the headphone out of Nexus one using tasker to start music when connected).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before I go into how I went about it, here is what it does now. When I keep the phone into my car&amp;rsquo;s phone holder, it automatically starts streaming music over BT from my car stereo and then when I keep it in my pocket, it stops.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ingredients I used:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>1 Galaxy Nexus&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>2 NFC tags (bought from tagstand guys. Makers of the awesome NFC Tasker Launcher app)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>1 male to male stereo cable&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>1 Samsung HS3000 BT headset (since my car stereo doesn&amp;rsquo;t have BT. This little headset is awesome because it is cheap (25$ or so at amazon), has a stereo port where you can connect any headset or stereo cable, implements apt-x protocol for high fidelity audio streaming)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Android App: NFC Task Launcher&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Android App: Tasker (NFC task launcher is enough for basic things but my task is a bit more involved)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Android App: Secure Settings plugin for Tasker/Locale&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So, what I did is this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Hardware&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pasted one NFC tag to my car phone holder and kept another one in my wallet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Connected the HS3000 headset to the car stereo through aux-in and to power through a car charger (it uses a standard micro usb port to charge).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stuck the HS3000 near my dashboard. I could have hidden it in dashboard or somewhere but I also wanted to use it to take calls when they come in so I can use its mic for speaking and incoming audio sounds through the car speakers. You can also disconnect the internal battery by popping up the casing so that it turns on and off with the car but it isn&amp;rsquo;t necessary as it anyways turns off if there is no device connected for a while.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Software&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Created two tasks in Tasker. First as &amp;ldquo;Car Mode Enter&amp;rdquo; and second as &amp;ldquo;Car Mode Exit&amp;rdquo;. The car mode enter task basically does this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If car mode is not already running (based on a variable)&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Turn on Bluetooth (This also auto connects)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Crank up the Media Volume&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If Battery level is above 40%&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Keep the screen always on (using Secure Settings)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Else keep the screen on if power is connected (through car charger)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Crank up the brightness if it is day time (so that I can see the screen) and store the old value for restoring later.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If navigation is not on (through another variable set through another profile which monitors if a navigation or maps app is in foreground)&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Load the Music app&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Start playing music&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Turn on the Read SMS profile cuz I&amp;rsquo;m a safe driver :) (Another profile in tasker which reads the incoming SMS&amp;rsquo; sender&amp;rsquo;s name and asks if it should read the text (don&amp;rsquo;t want any embarrassing ones read out while others are there in my car ;)) and then proceeds to read the text if I speak &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo;. For anything else or no input, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t read the text)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The car mode exit task undoes everything done in the car mode enter task and restores everything to how it was before entering the car mode.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also created two tasks in NFC task launcher which just launch the car mode enter and exit tasks when tapped against 1 of the tags and wrote this task to the tags.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>All together now:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we are done now. Now when I enter my car, I place the phone on the holder and nice music starts playing. When I get out, I tap it against my pocket (with the wallet) and everything is back at normal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let me know if you need any more information about the above setup or the tasker profile xml files. I use tasker for automating a whole other bunch of things as well. Will try to post that stuff soon along with any other NFC tricks I try out.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Bugs: What you see is not always what it is</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2012/07/23/bugs-what-you-see-is-not-always-what-it-is/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jul 2012 04:46:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2012/07/23/bugs-what-you-see-is-not-always-what-it-is/</guid><description>&lt;p>Came across a neat nugget of historical information today that &lt;a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/harris/500milemail.html">yet again&lt;/a> proves that the software/hardware bug behavior that you may see on the surface might imply something totally opposite to what the problem actually is.&lt;/p>

But as it turned out, the issue was the complete opposite. The real reason behind this problem was that linux was rock solid and stable compared to MS Dos.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Woah!! Hold on a minute, you say. How can being stable lead to hardware failure? Well, since DOS used to crash (or had to be rebooted) so often, it used to do a check on the floppy at boot up which used to shake up any dust on the drive. Since no such frequent reboots were required in linux, it caused a dust build up on the drive ultimately leading to it&amp;rsquo;s premature demise :(. Solution: A special program &amp;ldquo;diskseekd&amp;rdquo; whose sole purpose was to check the disk periodically to shake the dust out of the system and keep it happily working. Learned something nice today, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? :) Below is an excerpt frm the man page of diskseekd&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Several people have noticed that Linux has a bad tendency of killing floppy drives. These failures remained completely mysterious, until somebody noticed that they were due to huge layers of dust accumulating in the floppy drives. This cannot happen under Messy Dos, because this excuse for an operating system is so unstable that it crashes roughly every 20 minutes (actually less if you are running Windows). When rebooting, the BIOS seeks the drive, and by doing this, it shakes the dust out of the drive mechanism. diskseekd simulates this effect by seeking the drive periodically. If it is called as diskseek, the drive is seeked only once.&lt;/p>

I beg to differ.&lt;/p>

Thus, we can&amp;rsquo;t readily take this to directly and accurately predict the comparison results for iPhone 4S because there are other things to consider:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Mali-400 lags behing SGX543MP2 in &amp;ldquo;offscreen&amp;rdquo; tests which are done for resolutions greater than native SGS2 resolution (SGS 2 resolution is 800x480 while test is done at 720p) and brute triangle pushing. Samsung didn&amp;rsquo;t have to optimize their GPU implementation for this because SGS2 was never going to run a game at 720p resolution and would also need to push lesser triangles for similar detail. Hence they could easily make this trade-off to get lesser power consumption and heat generation&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Mali-400 goes hand in hand with SGX543MP2 in all other tests as seen on glbenchmark.com&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It is naive to think that the same SGX543MP2 implementation as iPad 2 will be present in iPhone 4S. Even if iPhone 4S is slated to have &amp;ldquo;A5&amp;rdquo;, a lot depends on the actual clock speeds (CPU and GPU), graphics memory, etc. Apple will do similar trade offs like Samsung (and Apple has already done this with A4 in iPad 1 vs iPhone 4) and the real results would be available only then.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>So, the end result is that we will have the real comparison only when iPhone 4S is out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PS: Not that the results matter anyways :P since firstly, the comparisons should now be moving to upcoming Nexus Prime and not SGS2 and secondly, the raw power of these GPUs won&amp;rsquo;t determine much since they cater to two completely different OSs and would have a lot of software and ecosystem dependencies on the user-perceived outcome.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Deconstructing The Samsung Nexus Prime Video</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2011/10/05/deconstructing-the-samsung-nexus-prime-video/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Oct 2011 05:59:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2011/10/05/deconstructing-the-samsung-nexus-prime-video/</guid><description>&lt;p>Samsung just uploaded a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM9RO-GAKjE">teaser video&lt;/a> to Youtube which hints at the upcoming Android phone &lt;strong>Nexus Prime&lt;/strong> with IceCream Sandwich.

&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The interesting thing however is the 3 dots on the left side&lt;/strong>. People claim that it could be related to camera or volume controls or even speaker grills. But I think that they are for dock connection. Anyone who has owned a Nexus One has seen the same 3 gold dots on the bottom used for dock connection. I believe that on Nexus Prime they have been moved to the side mainly because Prime has (or is supposed to have) a 16:9 screen and hence the optimal placement in a dock would be horizontal and hence the sideways placement.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

I tried all possible means, like putting it on a different server, installing from local disk, changing versions, deleting all cache, etc but still the issue persisted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally looking into the source code of the chromium browser svn repository, I got a clue. What google chrome does when you install a script as installation is that it first downloads the script, then it calls a function ConvertUserScriptToExtension to convert the script into a google chrome compatible script and then installs it. Now, since I had already installed this script once, I found that the script was already existing in my downloads directory, so while downloading chrome renames it to &lt;code>&amp;lt;file&amp;gt;(1).js&lt;/code> (i.e., appends a number to it to distinguish from the original file). But it seems like that the path sent to the conversion function still uses the original name/path and it somehow finds that the older file is not the downloaded one but also doesn&amp;rsquo;t know which is the current downloaded one and hence fails with an error &amp;ldquo;Could not read source file&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Solution: Pretty simple. Just delete the original file present in your download directory and then try installing the script and it will install fine :)&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Swype 3.25 Beta Pre-release Parse Error Solution</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2011/08/23/swype-3-25-beta-pre-release-parse-error-solution/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Aug 2011 18:07:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2011/08/23/swype-3-25-beta-pre-release-parse-error-solution/</guid><description>&lt;p>Swype just released their latest beta version 3.25 for Android phones but most of the folks are facing a &amp;ldquo;parse error&amp;rdquo; while trying to update to the latest version.

So, I thought of monitoring the usage at my router. It is a smart one (Asus wl-500w) and I can install various linux software on it but then it requires a hard disk to run most of them which I don&amp;rsquo;t turn on all the time.

Moreover, even if I could run the software directly from router flash, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have enough space to store the logs (neither is it a good idea to keep writing to the flash often).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hence I came up with the idea of a light weight remote bandwidth usage logger where in the router has to do the bare minimum possible (here, it just has to make a GET call to a webpage with current status of received and transmitted bytes, accomplished by a single line of wget command). The system is completely open source and is intelligent enough to keep track of things even if router reboots or the bytes count wraps around the 4 GB limit (because of 32 bit data structures used). The logging and parsing is all done on server side and provides various useful things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Few of the features of the system:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Very lightweight in CPU/RAM resource usage on host as well as server&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Outputs easy to browse html and graphs&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>User defined directory structure to decide the granularity that is wanted&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>yearly, monthly, daily stats and graphs&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Provides quick access to extra stats like last time the host connected, last known host IP etc&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Provides total download/upload numbers as well as detailed&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Estimates uptime of remote host&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Can use a DNS name or IP to avoid (or call out) spurious amounts of usage logged by a spurious IP&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

This is an Android smartphone meant for the entry level market. I had the phone for a few weeks to put it through its paces and here are some of my thoughts about it. I am not going to expand a lot on the general Android points as we all know about it but will concentrate succinctly and to-the-point on the aspects which can make it or break it for this phone against its competition in the similar price ranges.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="left" >
&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/huawei-ideos.gif" />
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>**Display: ** The display is average and pretty much on par with the other handsets in this range. It&amp;rsquo;s a low resolution QVGA (320x240) screen. While it&amp;rsquo;s usable but not a brilliant one and would give a sublime web browsing experience. The brightness of the display was average as well, nothing to write home about but not below the competition either.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Touchscreen: ** A good thing about this handset is that it has a capacitive touchscreen. A few entry level phones skimp out on this and put a resistive touchscreen but not so with Ideos. The screen response is pretty good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Android Version: ** Ideos sports Android 2.2 Froyo which is again a good thing since this is the latest I have seen in any entry/mid-level and most high end phones as well. Gingerbread is still too new and I&amp;rsquo;m happy enough with Froyo. A lot of other phones are still stuck on Eclair 2.1.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Camera: ** The camera is ok&amp;rsquo;ish with its 3.2 MP sensor and no LED flash. It works well for well lit subjects but is useless in dark. The quality of photos taken is average as well. Nothing extremely bad but nothing very good as well, just good enough for capturing spontaneous moments when you are not carrying your proper standalone camera with you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Connectivity: ** Ideos has 802.11n wi-fi and 7.2mbps HSDPA 3G for connectivity. wi-fi connected to my router in a snap and it also has hotspot (or wireless tethering) capability for upto 8 devices. 3G connectivity was ok. Speedtest results came out to be similar to my Nexus one over both wi-fi as well as 3G.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Built: ** Ideos is built sturdily but looks a bit tacky with its shiny back. But then again, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to find a good looking phone in entry level smartphones which performs according to it&amp;rsquo;s looks as well. I didn&amp;rsquo;t try any drop tests on it but I&amp;rsquo;d fathom it&amp;rsquo;d easily survive any short falls. The phone is also pretty light and small, easy to pocket.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Performance: ** Ideos has a Qualcomm MSM7227 processor, rated at a clock speed of 528 MHz. This processor is fairly standard in almost all the entry level devices and is good enough for daily usage and most of the apps. But most games would struggle on it. If you are buying this (or any other entry level smartphone) with the correct expectations of it performing according to it&amp;rsquo;s price range, you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be disappointed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Web Browsing: ** Web browsing is mediocre on Ideos because of it&amp;rsquo;s low resolution screen, low specc&amp;rsquo;ed processor (which also results in lack of Adobe Flash). If you plan on using the browser for your web needs, don&amp;rsquo;t bet on opening any javascript heavy pages quickly and should look mostly to fill the void by using specific apps for the services you are trying to access.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Battery: ** The phone is good on the battery and it was able to last around 1.5-2 days on a single charge for medium usage even though it houses just a 1200 mAh. This is on-par, if not better, than most other phones in this range.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**GPS: ** The GPS was quick to get a fix and retained it to a good accuracy almost same as my Nexus one. Using Google maps on this phone was a breeze.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Other Notes: ** The phone bundles a free 2GB microSD card and also stereo headphones. The headphones are average at best like most other phones and you should really pair it with a cheap set of Creative IEMs that will give you a much better output while staying on a budget.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Conclusion: ** While the phone is not a powerhouse in itself, I&amp;rsquo;d rate it pretty good in it&amp;rsquo;s price segment. If I had to buy an Android smartphone on a budget around 8000 INR, it&amp;rsquo;d be a toss up between this and the Samsung Galaxy Pop S5570. So, this is a +1 recommendation from me for this phone.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Google Music Beta Latest APK version 3.0.1 for Android</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2011/05/27/google-music-latest-apk-android-3-0-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 May 2011 03:57:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2011/05/27/google-music-latest-apk-android-3-0-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>Google just released the latest version of its Music app  that ties into its cloud player service Music Beta.

&lt;p>That was that but it seems like the episode has given a brilliant idea to a few others as well. Import cheap/sub-standard products from China, rebrand them, ask government for subsidy and claim to have &amp;ldquo;invented&amp;rdquo; a revolutionary low cost computing device. &lt;strong>iWebLeaf&lt;/strong> is a case in point. I came across them through a couple of articles where this little company formed by a couple of engineering students has invented two ultra low cost products: A &lt;a href="http://telecomtalk.info/iwebleaf-comes-with-cheapest-3g-data-card-at-rs1300/50814/">3G data card for 1300 INR&lt;/a> (~ $30) and a &lt;a href="http://telecomtalk.info/iwebleaf-refused-funding-to-launch-low-cost-laptop-data-card/60941/">Laptop for 5000 INR&lt;/a> (~ $110). I was pleasantly surprised and my initial reaction was to applaud the effort. Then I noticed that these products, although announced for quite some time and having gotten a LOT of mainstream media coverage on almost every news channel, have not come to the market yet. The reasons for the 3G card are unknown but the laptop was said to have been dropped because of lack of Government support (read &amp;ldquo;subsidy&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Disclaimer: Before you read any further, please note that I&amp;rsquo;m an Indian myself and stay in India only (i.e., not a condescending NRI). I am a developer myself and love innovating and innovators and have the greatest respect for all that our country has given to the world. This piece is a rant against only those few individuals who make the rest of the India look bad by claiming authority over fake innovations.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Being a part of the semiconductor industry for quite some time, I was curious to find out how they achieved this feat which no one else including big name companies have been able to do even after years of research (XO-PC). I looked at the purported specs of the laptop and it struck me that yet again, the BoM itself was much more than 5000 INR. When I raised some questions about this, the &amp;ldquo;innovators&amp;rdquo; replied that they are saving all this money because they &amp;ldquo;developed their own processor DXA16&amp;rdquo; which is equivalent to a 1.6GHz Intel Atom. What again raised even more doubts in mind was that they said their processor didn&amp;rsquo;t have anything to do with Intel and they didn&amp;rsquo;t even have to take an X86 license even though they claim windows support for the laptop, which means that their processor MUST be x86 compatible. Secondly, they mentioned that they have got jobs in TCS and CTS and won&amp;rsquo;t continue further. I&amp;rsquo;m completely flummoxed why an under-graduate student who has designed his own commercially viable micro processor in a college lab during a period when other students struggle to just write 10 line assembly programs, would go and join a mass-recruiting services company. If I was him, any company from Intel to TI to Qualcomm to ARM would be ready to hire me for any salary that I demanded. On top of this, they gave weird reasons to drop it that they want to do it only for Orissa and no other state, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was also mind-blowing that they made such great inventions but &lt;a href="http://www.iwebleaf.com/">their own website&lt;/a> doesn&amp;rsquo;t have even a single word about these. All they have there is the run of the mill Web-Hosting, SEO, site design, blah blah.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyways, another person on the same forum where I raised the doubts uncovered an ugly truth. Their data card is nothing but a rebranded chinese card. See this link: &lt;a href="http://www.dealextreme.com/p/7-2mbps-hsdpa-3g-usb-2-0-wireless-modem-adapter-with-tf-card-slot-white-50297">Cheap 3G Data Card&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Points to note:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>This card has the exact same specs including speeds, features (e.g. same RAM, ROM amounts, sd card etc)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It costs around $35 for a single piece including shipping. So, for bulk purchase, you can easily get it much cheaper and sell it around the $30 price.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It looks exactly the same  with just an iWebLeaf logo slapped over the version sold by these innovators.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>**Note: **You can also see this video of &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnEhrn1GwiM">iWebLeaf Data Card&lt;/a> and compare it against the rest of the pics on &lt;a href="http://www.dealextreme.com/p/7-2mbps-hsdpa-3g-usb-2-0-wireless-modem-adapter-with-tf-card-slot-white-50297">Deal Extreme site for the chinese card&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Laptop:&lt;/strong> I was even more skeptical about their laptop now. And I was flabbergasted with surprise when I found out that all it took me was around 2 minutes of search for &amp;ldquo;cheap chinese laptop&amp;rdquo; on china trader sites like alibaba/traderkey etc and I stumbled onto a company called Enzo-Tech. If I could do this in 2 minutes, couldn&amp;rsquo;t the rest of the mainstream media folks do a little bit of fact check with their vast resources? They &lt;a href="http://www.alibaba.com/product-gs/371893567/cheap_10_2_inch_mini_laptop.html">produce&lt;/a> a &lt;a href="http://enzo-tech.com/Product.aspx?id=28">10&amp;quot; Mini Laptop&lt;/a> which, just like the data card:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Has the exact same specs as the iWebLeaf laptop (except that they list Atom as the processor instead of DXA16, which is a farce anyways)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Looks exactly the same with just iWebLeaf stickers pasted all over. (Pics below)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The only concern here is that even this laptop is not available for the low price that iWebLeaf mentioned. This laptop sells for around $200 in small quantities. If bought for very large quantities (e.g. in thousands or 10s of thousands by a government), the price would come down radically and with a little bit more of subsidy, it can achieve the price that iWebLeaf mentioned. But it would still be &amp;ldquo;cost price&amp;rdquo;. Sale price to end users will have to be much higher due to customs, logistics, handling, shipping, etc even if they were to sell it on a no-profit basis.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>**Note: **You can also see this&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gj6pwQKIZc"> video of iWebLeaf Laptop&lt;/a> and compare it against the pics/specs on &lt;a href="http://enzo-tech.com/Product.aspx?id=28">Enzo-Tech&amp;rsquo;s website&lt;/a> and see that it is the same.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What to make of it? I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything against these guys as entrepreneurs. They have every right to import, rebrand and resell products. A huge number of people and companies do this. What I take offense to, however, is to claim that they invented these things which isn&amp;rsquo;t true and then blame the Government for not allowing them to prosper by not spending the tax money I pay for their benefits. Moreover, this not only shames other &amp;ldquo;True&amp;rdquo; Indian innovators when these fakes are discovered but also sets wrong examples for our budding engineers to choose the shortest path possible to get 15 minutes of fame and then a job instead of really doing something to make the nation proud. I&amp;rsquo;m also yet again dis-illusioned by our mainstream media who will report anything and everything under the sun just to get more eyeballs and TRP without doing any sort of fact-checks. Yes, YOU SO CALLED TECH JOURNALISTS, I am calling you out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>In the end, I will make my offer to iWebLeaf guys again as I made to them elsewhere.

I&amp;rsquo;ve just talked to a pretty reliable source within the Android ranks of Google that Google is going to distance itself &lt;strong>legally&lt;/strong> from Android and spin it off in a separate company. The source said that the move can happen very soon and may be announced at Google I/O conference in May. Although details are sketchy and only very few high profile folks know about it within Google, my source says that the probable reason is increasing worries about legal aspects of Android with respect to Patents and IP law suits. Google also doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to be held responsible by any of the OEMs using Android when they are targeted by these law suits. So, they arrived at this decision &lt;strong>to create a win-win situation where the new company will still be handed over instructions from MountainView through back channels but liabilities of the company are going to be very limited because they will show zero or no earnings at all.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>Now, this is mind blowing.

&lt;p>I can see everyone from Cupertino to Redmond running helter skelter by this move from Google as they will lose one major weapon in their armory in their &amp;ldquo;Take no prisoners&amp;rdquo; war against Android&amp;rsquo;s rapid growth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll keep you guys updated as I get more details on this.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Now, of course, kinect doesn&amp;rsquo;t work with PS3 obviously but then if we can&amp;rsquo;t break the rules, we can at least bend them a little towards our way. I&amp;rsquo;ve  created a mashup that allows you to use kinect as an input controller for the PS3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Please note that this is pre-alpha quality software currently&lt;/strong>. I haven&amp;rsquo;t updated to a lot of recent code for the below libraries and also haven&amp;rsquo;t done most of the performance/feature improvements yet. The axis performance specially needs lot of tweaking and it works well only while sitting. Putting this out purely as a proof of concept. For the things that I plan to add soon, please see the Todo section below. Follow me at &lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/shantanugoel">@shantanugoel&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> for latest updates.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The program makes use of several other programs in order to provide this functionality. To compile/use it, you also need the following programs:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenNI/OpenNI">OpenNI Libraries&lt;/a> - To get data from kinect&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.openni.org/downloadfiles/">NITE Libraries&lt;/a> (Choose &amp;ldquo;Middleware&amp;rdquo; on the page) - Builds on top of OpenNI to provide gesture detection etc&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/boilerbots/Sensor">PrimeSense Libraries for kinect&lt;/a> - Kinect drivers to get raw data&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/diyps3controller/">DIYPS3Controller&lt;/a> - The main component for PS3 connection and also known as sixaxis emulator. This emulates a DS3 on the PC and send the inputs to PS3 through bluetooth.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Installation/Compilation/Usage&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Make sure that the above 4 things are installed on your machine and working fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Download the source of this project to the NITE Samples directory. You can even place it anywhere else but you would need to tweak the makefile to account for the changed paths.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Make any changes to the source that you need.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Change the included ps3 controller config xml file and place it in one of the locations where diyps3controller can find it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Run make -f kinect-ps3.mak&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The executable will be available in Samples/Bin directory of NITE.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Run kinect-ps3 (without any arguments)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Run emuclient (from ps3 controller software) and choose the new xml config file&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Become the controller&amp;rdquo; :)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Default Config&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Menu Profile - This is the default profile that kinect-ps3 starts with and allows to operate the PS3 menus. Moving hand in any direction will move the ps3 menus as if you were using the DPAD with those directions keys pressed. If you run out of the kinect&amp;rsquo;s watched space, then just do a backward push with your hand, bring your hand to center and then again do the backward push and continue scrolling. This is like you lift your finger up and then start dragging from edges of a laptop&amp;rsquo;s touchpad.For selecting any item, make two successive push movements with your hand without changing any x-y direction.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Game Profile - This profile can be switched to by doing 3 successive backward movements of the hand while in Menu profile. Right now I&amp;rsquo;ve implemented only directional controls in game profile because I&amp;rsquo;m still struggling with multiple hands detections and skeletal tracking. A full profile will be activated soon enough. Currently, the your hand&amp;rsquo;s x/y movements and directly translated to right stick x/y movements (e.g. this is looking in different directions in various FPS games). Moving the hand towards or away from kinect (z-axis) translate to left stick y movements (e.g. this is moving fowards or backwards in most FPS games).

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Coming Soon/ToDo&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>-Full Menu and Game profiles&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Skeletal tracking for better game profiles&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Switching back to menu profiles from game profiles&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Easier way to specify user custom profiles instead of changing code for the same&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Performance improvement for game profiles&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

But the problem I faced was that my programs were compiling and running without any errors but I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t see the effect happening, i.e., the events weren&amp;rsquo;t getting injected into the system. I am using Ubuntu Maverick Meerkat (10.10) and when I searched on the net, I saw various other folks are facing the same issue. I finally got it working and here is how.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First problem I came across was that I was using &amp;ldquo;/dev/input/uinput&amp;rdquo; path in my programs but it seems it is changed to &amp;ldquo;/dev/uinput&amp;rdquo; in Ubuntu. Changing this got me past some runtime errors I was getting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I thought that the issue was because uinput module wasn&amp;rsquo;t getting loaded because even after specifically doing a modprobe, I still couldn&amp;rsquo;t see it loaded when I did lsmod. This was strange because the /dev/uinput node was present. On looking under /lib, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even find the uinput.ko file. But then I found that the reason for this is that in Ubuntu Maverick, uinput is not a module anymore. It is built into the kernel now. (See this &lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bluez/+bug/584812">launchpad bug&lt;/a>.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, having figured that the above was a false alarm, I was at a loss how to explain this. But then I tried just changing the permissions of the uinput node to 0666 (i.e. writable by all users) and ran my program without sudo and it worked like a charm. Searching for sudo along with uinput lead me to &lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sudo/+bug/609645">these&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://www.sudo.ws/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=388">bugs&lt;/a> which confirms that the problem is because of this only. So, if you are facing this issue, you can either change the uinput node permissions or install the sudo patch described in the bug discussion page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let me know if this worked for you as well :)&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>PSN Ban-Wave Phishing Scam</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2011/02/17/psn-ban-wave-phishing-scam/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Feb 2011 09:25:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2011/02/17/psn-ban-wave-phishing-scam/</guid><description>&lt;p>**Update: **I did some more digging and the email and the links actually seem to be legitimate.

&lt;li>Any balance in and all future payments into your PayPal account may not be used to buy goods or services and must be transferred to your bank account in India within 7 days from the receipt of confirmation from the buyer in respect of the goods or services; and&lt;/li>

&lt;p>So no more buying stuff. It is only useful for getting payments now (and that too &amp;lt;500$ per transaction).

&lt;p>As I posted in the comments there, the &amp;ldquo;article&amp;rdquo; has fail written all over it. Points to note:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Moms make the choice, not toddlers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The sample set is too small&lt;/li>
&lt;li>iPhone has been selling for 3 years and WP7 for like 1 month..so D.U.H&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The iPhone apps also sell on iPod/iPad.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s not &amp;ldquo;Windows 7 phones&amp;rdquo;, its &amp;ldquo;Windows Phone 7&amp;rdquo; lol. One of the most prominent tech blogs can&amp;rsquo;t even get the name right.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Acc to TechCrunch, &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>Data like this hints at the total run rate for Win7 phones&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo;, so basically WP7 has already sold around 12 million already (Total iOS devices sold till now is around 120mn acc to Jobs). That&amp;rsquo;s mighty impressive for a one month run.. :P&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>On a serious note, I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect this post to be coming from Mike.

&lt;p>One of my friends at work received an email recently from Rovio announcing the new &amp;ldquo;Seasons&amp;rdquo; edition for Christmas and Halloween levels. But that is not the important thing, something else is. Read this:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Angry Birds Seasons Available For Android&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, we bring you Angry Birds Seasons, a special edition spin-off of Angry Birds!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Season?s Greedings consists of 25 daily surprises for fans of Angry Birds to enjoy while counting down the days until Christmas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Included in the game is also the 45-level Halloween special edition, now packaged as a separate episode called Trick Or Treat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Angry Birds Seasons is available for Android devices through GetJar and Android Market.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Payment option and performance  upgrades to follow&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are still working on two things for the Angry Birds games on Android:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, we are bringing a graphically lighter option in the game, to enable better performance on older phones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Second, we will introduce a payment system to opt-out of advertising.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both of these upgrades will be included in later updates.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So as you can see, Rovio is about to bring out a paid option for Android folks as well so that we can kill those pigs in peace :)&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Review of X-Mini Capsule Happy Speakers</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/11/28/review-of-x-mini-capsule-happy-speakers/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Nov 2010 16:22:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/11/28/review-of-x-mini-capsule-happy-speakers/</guid><description>&lt;p>I received a few portable speakers as review pieces from &lt;a href="http://www.x-mini.com/">x-mini&lt;/a> a few days ago.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>In The Package&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The package included the following things:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The X-Mini Happy Capsule Speaker&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>USB Charging Cable&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>A soft cloth pouch for carrying&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>A set of earphones&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>User Manual&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Notes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The manual mentions that a microSD card should also be present but I didn&amp;rsquo;t find any in the box.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The USB charging cable comes with a 3.5mm cord attached to it as well. This led me to believe that it could be one of those charge and play type cable which could carry sound over it as well but that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the case and only the USB charging part was usable. Perhaps they bundled the cable from another one of their models which allows this.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Things I liked:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Inbuilt retractable 3.5 mm cord&lt;/strong>. Really loved this as I hate carrying so many cables with me while travelling. With this cable, you can easily connect it to any of your sound sources with a 3.5 mm slot (e.g. laptop/media player/phone etc) for instant sound gratification and then stow away the cable at the bottom when not needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Inbuilt SD card slot&lt;/strong>. You can insert an SD card filled with MP3s into this slot and play those songs from the speaker directly without needing any separate media player. This is an awesome feature. Playback controls are provided on the side and overlap with the volume controls. The speaker supports upto 8GB cards and you can copy songs to-and-fro from the card without removing it from the speakers. The supplied USB cable can also be used to access the speaker in mass storage mode to talk to the SD card.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Headphone out (or as they call it &amp;ldquo;BuddyJack&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/strong>. You can connect your headphones to the speaker and listen to songs. This port has three advantages. First is that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to fiddle with your laptop/media player&amp;rsquo;s port if you want to use your headphones for sometime instead of using these speakers. Second is that you can use this speaker as a media player itself by inserting an SD card into the speaker as listed above. Lastly, you can use this port to chain multiple X-Mini Happy speakers together in order to get louder output.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>InBuilt Rechargable Battery Pack&lt;/strong>. This is another good feature. Many of the portable speakers that I tried draw their power from the USB port. This is good enough to use with laptops but not for media players/phones. The X-Mini Happy speakers have built in rechargable batteries that can be charged from the USB port. The user manual states that the battery should run for around 5 hours when fully charged. In my testing, this was farely accurate and across multiple tests, they ran for around 4-5 hours in general with continuous playback.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>**- Sound Quality. **Volume wise, these speakers can get fairly loud. They were good enough to fill a fairly sized room and I was able to watch a movie by sitting at a diagonally opposite end (around 15 feet) without missing any dialogs. The speakers also had fairly good bass (low frequency) reproduction for their size. This could be due to their unique vacuum resonator (a rubbery tube like design which can be expanded when using the speakers and then compressed to save space while travelling). They were also ok in mid and high frequencies but the thing to be noted here is that for a portable speaker, they are better than anything I have come across so far.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/x-mini-happy-capsule-speaker-closed-thumb.jpg" />
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Drawbacks&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only drawback is that this is a single speaker unit so the sound output is monaural. This is also the reason that I prefer the X-Mini Max II capsule speakers more than this (review coming soon) although they don&amp;rsquo;t come with as many bells and whistles as the Happy capsule speakers. Apart from that, a minor niggle is that the supplied earphones could be better to round out the package.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Conclusion&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Are these speakers going to replace my full blown speaker set at home? No. But that is not the point. As a portable speaker, the X-mini Happy Capsule speaker packs a lot of punch while taking only a couple of inches and also playing double duty as a mp3/wma player that I&amp;rsquo;d pick it without a doubt.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>ZDNet Fail.

(BTW, half the people say Android is fail because it is not open and the other half say it is fail because it is open. Which one is it, please decide ;) )&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The solution is a Google Phone with google branding, sold unlocked at full price.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Let me answer 2nd point first. Dana Blankenhorn, thanks for that nice blast from the past advice. Google already did it with Nexus One, like, one year ago duh..&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, on to the first point. Even if lot of people are stripping off Google search, they still have a big share of the mobile search market. They didn&amp;rsquo;t create Android solely to earn from it directly. It was more of a way to ensure that they still have an avenue for mobile revenue which would have otherwise been completely lost (iPhone). Another thing here is that if they didn&amp;rsquo;t keep it open enough for other players, it might have not got such widespread adoption or they might have been killed in US/EU under antitrust laws.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, all I can say to Dana and ZDNet is &amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;-&amp;gt; kthxbi :P&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>A short Tablet/Smartphone survey for a project</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/11/15/short-tablet-smartphone-survey-project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2010 04:10:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/11/15/short-tablet-smartphone-survey-project/</guid><description>&lt;p>I need a bit of your help in filling out a short survey that I need for a small project of mine that I&amp;rsquo;m doing with a friend.

Many also say that Windows Phone 7 is a threat to Android because it solves the problem of Apple&amp;rsquo;s draconian policies, gives choice to customers and all this without fragmenting the OS all over the place.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>Many people say that Windows Phone 7 is a threat to iPhone because they are bringing in a super platform with a choice of multiple designs and multiple carriers with great Enterprise and gaming support and maintaining the lucrative integration that iPhone provides. Many also say that Windows Phone 7 is a threat to Android because it solves the problem of Apple&amp;rsquo;s draconian policies, gives choice to customers and all this without fragmenting the OS all over the place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, I beg to differ. Windows Phone 7 is a threat to the world wide web and web apps. It plans to help the developers and users by going one up on fragmentation of Android but in the process will fragment the web app world itself. This is because the browser in WP7 is based on Internet Explorer 7. Yes, not IE 9, not IE8, but IE7, which is already four years old now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Right now, if you have to do a web app, you can do it in HTML5, CSS3 etc and assume that it will work over most mobile handsets out there. Enter WP7 with its archaic browser and the developer has one more headache to solve. His app will be, in most cases, incompatible with the &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; platform and so he will have to code another version that works on IE7 as well. This will not only result in wasted time and effort but in fact, the developer may even have to hold back on features that might not work well on this ugly duckling which will hold the whole pack down for God knows how much more time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, there it is. If the Android fragmentation reports are true, you can just buy another handset like an iPhone but this comeback-from-the-grave monster will fragment the mobile web app world itself so that you won&amp;rsquo;t have any reprieve whichever phone you buy. So, I appeal to you. If you want a better mobile future, talk about it, write about it and let Microsoft know that it can and must do better.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Is Android Open Source Or Not?</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/10/25/android-open-source-or-not/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Oct 2010 11:31:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/10/25/android-open-source-or-not/</guid><description>&lt;p>Is Android really open source or not?

&lt;p>A lot out of the rest of the people, who are indeed informed, make the mistake of thinking that &amp;ldquo;Open Source = GPL&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Open Source = Free Software&amp;rdquo;, which is not true. Open source is similar to free software but is one that choses to keep more options open. In short, Free Software Movement, as the one evangelized by FSF, is a subset of open source that tries to achieve freedom of software by restriction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please also note that many people including Steve Jobs confuse people more by interchanging between open and open source. An android phone that you get may not be open, the android market may be open, etc but this discussion is purely about open-source.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyways, with asbestos underwear on, I write this post to speak my mind about this matter by talking about various points thrown up by the above mentioned classes. Since this is going to be a long post, I&amp;rsquo;ll mention here the things it is going to cover:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Allegations against Android&amp;rsquo;s open-source nature. Are they true?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Does OSI Foundation (&lt;a href="http://www.opensource.org">Open source Initiative&lt;/a>) think that Android is open source?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Android and open source in layman terms&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Takeaways/conclusion&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update&lt;/strong>: Updated the article as per Tony and Kasper&amp;rsquo;s comments below. Thanks Kasper and Tony for your valuable inputs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="android-and-open-source-allegations-and-answers">Android and Open Source: Allegations and Answers&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Allegation&lt;/strong>: Google does a lot of development in private for few months and then releases the code to public.
&lt;strong>Answer&lt;/strong>: Almost every open source project I know does this. Do you think every person who works on an open source project pushes his code to the mainline 10 times when re writes a 10 line code? No. He completes the feature, tests it and then pushes it out. Individuals might do it sooner, companies might do it later but everyone pushes out their code when they feel things are fairly ready. So, Google choses to do the &amp;ldquo;push&amp;rdquo; every few months when they think their new feature set is ready. This, of course, is more influenced by the fact that they need to be competitive in the aggressive mobile market and hence not let the competitors know about the exact features but still it is well within the limits of open source. And they are doing it before/with the binary release as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also to be noted here is the fact that the &amp;ldquo;code dump&amp;rdquo; is done only for major releases. Minor fixes and even features keep trickling into the code base every now and then and these allow others to make fixes as well. e.g. Cyanogen was able to bring &amp;ldquo;802.11n&amp;rdquo; capability and was able to include various fixes including one for wi-fi sleep policies before they actually made into an OTA update for any phone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Allegation&lt;/strong>: Only google employees can check in code to mainline.
&lt;strong>Answer&lt;/strong>: Every open source project has only a select few folks who can check in code. Most of the open source projects start with only their founders having commit access. They may or may not give commit accesses to anyone else. Check out various open source projects on sourceforge, googlecode, etc and you will find this. Most of the projects that do choose to give commit access to others, start doing it after some time when they feel the project is mature enough and they are confident enough in someone else. Android is just a hatchling, around 2 years old. It has begun making strides only now so Google may even choose to take the latter path but I can understand if Google wants to keep this as their control point because of the hustle and bustle of the mobile OS world which is much more rapid and cut throat than the desktop OS and this does not make them closed. Not only that, but seeing how everyone in the mobile world is so trigger happy with suing everyone else, it creates a legal issue for them as they would be the ones to answer if someone else brings this upon them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Allegation&lt;/strong>: Google only accepts their own code into official android and nobody else&amp;rsquo;s.
&lt;strong>Answer&lt;/strong>: This one is hilarious. Obviously, anyone who says this hasn&amp;rsquo;t actually been to review.android.com. Just go their and check whether any merged changes have non-google, non-android email ids. Anyone can upload their patches there but the accepted ones are fairly low. This problem is present in every popular open source project, even the Linux kernel. But is more pronounced in the case of android because Google&amp;rsquo;s android team is much smaller than the number of persons working on other projects and there is red tape of a big company involved. If you want to get your patch in, just like the kernel, you need to engage with them. Talk to them in the relevant bug report, comment the code properly, give them a reason to not avoid your patch. But yes, the process is still very slow and it is eons faster to just contribute to a fork like cyanogenmod. I do hope that google does get better in this regard soon though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Allegation&lt;/strong>: It is not possible to make a full android build from the public code tree of android.
&lt;strong>Answer&lt;/strong>: BS. Cyanogen does just fine with his full AOSP builds. People argue that Google does not release the modem/baseband code but they idiotically fail to realize that the baseband code is not part of Android at all. It is the IP of the baseband manufacturer and is specific to each hardware. Android is just the code that runs on apps hardware. Google does not indeed release the code of their built in google apps (gtalk/gmail etc) though but they are already working towards that and these apps will not be a part of the base Android system anymore. These would be standalone apps and even now you don&amp;rsquo;t need them to make a fully working android build.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Allegation&lt;/strong>: &amp;ldquo;Android&amp;rdquo; is a registered trademark and is held by Google.
&lt;strong>Answer&lt;/strong>: Linus holds the trademark for &amp;ldquo;Linux&amp;rdquo;, Mozilla foundation holds the trademark for &amp;ldquo;Firefox&amp;rdquo;, Canonical holds the trademark for &amp;ldquo;Ubuntu&amp;rdquo;. Get the drift? Basically, it is completely possible and allowed for an open source software to be trademarked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Allegation&lt;/strong>: Google doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop the carriers/OEMs from locking down the phones, adding bloatware or custom UIs.
&lt;strong>Answer&lt;/strong>: This is an issue with carriers/OEMs and not Android. Google uses the apache software license (ASL), which is a permissive license (like MIT, BSD, etc) and hence does not stop the carriers from doing such a thing (In fact, this is the very foundation of being open, check the next passage about OSI foundation, point no. 9). Many people say they should, but if they did then they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be open anymore, would they?
Even Linus Torvalds is against making such a stipulation of not allowing locking of phones and this is the biggest reason why the Linux Kernel (and lot of other open source projects) didn&amp;rsquo;t move to FSF&amp;rsquo;s (&lt;a href="http://www.fsf.org">Free Software Foundation&lt;/a>) GPL v3. I wonder why no one calls the Linux kernel closed hmmmm&amp;hellip;
BTW, if you are so serious about unlocked/rootable phones then buy a dev phone directly from google or get one from Synapse.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="android-and-open-source-osi-foundation">Android and Open Source: OSI Foundation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The OSI foundation has a few guidelines to determine whether something is open source or not under their &lt;a href="http://www.opensource.org/osd.html">Open Source Definition&lt;/a>. Android uses the OSI compatible Apache Software License (ASL) but still let&amp;rsquo;s see whether Android comes up to all of them or not. If it is in conflict with even one of the requisites, we will call Android closed.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Allow free redistribution - Check&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Give out un-obfuscated source code - Check&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Allow modifications and derived works - Check&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Allow distribution of modifications (as patches) or modified software as a whole. Can restrict the modified versions from using original name of software - Check&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No discrimination against any person or groups - Check&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No restriction of using the software on any device or field - Check&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No additional license needed - Check&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No product-specific license - Check&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No restriction on software distributed along with original software - Check&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Technology neutral, i.e., no preference for an individual technology or user interface - Check
So, Android is true to each and every point that being open demands to it. In fact, points 9 and 10 are fundamental in making it open but alas, people less oriented with open software tend to term this as being closed (as seen in the last allegation above)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="android-and-open-source-from-a-laymans-view-point">Android and Open Source: From a layman&amp;rsquo;s view point&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Apart from the above, I would also like to share a few &amp;ldquo;layman-examples&amp;rdquo; which will let you understand for yourself why Android is open:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You can see all the official android OS code without any restrictions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can download it, fork it, modify it without asking google&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can port it to any device without asking google&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can develop and sell your phone with Android without asking google
Now compare that with any other mobile OS you know.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="android-and-open-source-conclusion">Android and Open Source: Conclusion&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>So, the takeaways from the above wall of text are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Android is open-source&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Android is permissively open-source instead of being restrictive&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Android can do better in terms of community driven development but is perhaps held back by pace of competition and legalities involved. But, this in no way makes it non-open-source.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Let me know if you have any corrections or allegations to make :)&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>What does caret (^) in an apt-get command mean?</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/10/23/apt-get-caret/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Oct 2010 18:03:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/10/23/apt-get-caret/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you have come across a tutorial or just someone on a forum who tells you to install something in Debian/Ubuntu that involves using apt-get, it is ok for you but when they tell you that you need to use a caret symbol (^) at the end, that&amp;rsquo;s where you become curious. What is even more weird is that when you search for the name of the package that the given command seems to install cannot be found using apt-cache search. e.g. You will see this used most often when someone tells you how to install LAMP server setup (Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP) by using the command &amp;ldquo;sudo apt-get install lamp-server^&amp;rdquo;. If you miss the caret at the end or try to search for lamp-server, it just doesn&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>If you have come across a tutorial or just someone on a forum who tells you to install something in Debian/Ubuntu that involves using apt-get, it is ok for you but when they tell you that you need to use a caret symbol (^) at the end, that&amp;rsquo;s where you become curious.

If you miss the caret at the end or try to search for lamp-server, it just doesn&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, the answer is that the caret symbol is a short form for performing a task that otherwise the program &amp;ldquo;tasksel&amp;rdquo; would have done with the given package name. tasksel is a program to ease the installation of commonly used things that go together for a particular use. e.g. In the above instance of LAMP, the four packages and their dependencies are always used together, so tasksel provides a sort of a meta-package or meta-task that can be run by the user with a single command and then tasksel will take it upon itself to install all of them and set them up correctly for your use. Now, apt-get provides a way to perform that same task by itself without you having to install tasksel first and all you have to do is to give that same package name to apt-get but just append a caret at the end to tell apt-get that it is a tasksel package/task identifier and not a regular package name in debian/ubuntu repositories.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hope that clears things up :)&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Android Paid Apps Now Live In India</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/10/05/android-paid-apps-now-live-in-india/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2010 07:35:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/10/05/android-paid-apps-now-live-in-india/</guid><description>&lt;p>Yes!

&lt;p>You can see the paid apps on main list and in the &amp;ldquo;Just In&amp;rdquo; Tab but there is no &amp;ldquo;Top Paid&amp;rdquo; tab available. (**Update: **If you can&amp;rsquo;t see the &amp;ldquo;top paid&amp;rdquo; tab, then go to settings-&amp;gt;Applications-&amp;gt;All-&amp;gt;Market and clear data and cache &amp;amp; launch market app again. You will be able to see top paid tab as well :) )&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You can, however, search for any paid app or follow a direct marketplace link fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Final payment is done in the original currency of the app developer (e.g. pounds or dollars)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The payment method is credit cards through Google Checkout.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Debit cards won&amp;rsquo;t work for payment. Even though google checkout accepts them, they show up as &amp;ldquo;invalid&amp;rdquo; while buying apps. I presume that this is because of the 24 hour refund feature of Android marketplace.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Carrier Billing is not available though&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Another new thing reported. &amp;ldquo;Update All&amp;rdquo; feature which was so far available only on Froyo ROMs has also been included for devices with older Android versions. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure which all versions have it but it is at least showing up on 2.1 (Eclair) ROMs now.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Let me know if you can see the paid apps as well. If you cannot, try these two things:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Open Phone app and dial &amp;ldquo;*#*#2432546#*#*&amp;rdquo; and wait. You should get a &amp;ldquo;Checkin succeeded&amp;rdquo; notification.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Restart your phone.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

Could &amp;ldquo;Carrier Billing&amp;rdquo; (Allowing your service operator to add the apps&amp;rsquo; price to your cellphone bill) be the reason behind it? I think so. It was long suggested that Google Checkout and corresponding legal issues in using it across various countries was the reason behind the paid apps not being available in those countries.

&lt;p>What&amp;rsquo;s more is that the agreement had a 30 day period to be accepted (August end), and then just one month after that we got the news of so many new countries being added. Sounds mighty coincidental to me. I think it would have been much easier for google to work through the carriers to allow paid apps than burning through all that red tape for its own google checkout.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is good news, if true because carrier billing is much more convenient I think. Plus it can be used even if you do not own a credit card. Let&amp;rsquo;s hope for the best :)&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Android Paid Apps Available In India</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/10/01/android-paid-apps-india/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2010 03:40:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/10/01/android-paid-apps-india/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just got a mail from Google that paid apps are being made available in India.

&lt;p>This the list that I received:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Effective today, developers from 20 additional countries (Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland and Taiwan) can now sell paid apps on Android Market. Over the next 2 weeks, users from 18 new countries (Argentina, Brazil, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Israel, Mexico, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Sweden, and Taiwan) will be able to purchase paid apps from Android Market.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Now, let&amp;rsquo;s hope that Google allows Indian developers to sell their apps soon as well. :)&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Setup Call Recording With Android App Tasker On Nexus One</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/09/24/setup-call-recording-android-app-tasker-nexus-one/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Sep 2010 10:01:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/09/24/setup-call-recording-android-app-tasker-nexus-one/</guid><description>&lt;p>I wanted to record calls on my Android phone (Nexus one).

&lt;p>So, let’s begin. My visioned scenario is like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>When you start a call (incoming or outgoing), i.e., when both the parties have picked up the phone, a notification should appear in the status bar.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Clicking on this notification should start recording the call. It should also give way to another notification now.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>This new notification should stop the call recording when clicked.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If you don’t stop the call recording, the recording should automatically stop when the call ends.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>To achieve the steps mentioned above, you will have to create “4” profiles in tasker. The xml files for these profiles are provided in a zip at the end of this article that you can download and import into tasker directly. If you want to understand more about whats going on, here are the details of each profile so that you can understand and modify them according to your needs. These profiles are:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Profile 1. Call Started&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tasker description:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Profile: Call started
Event: Phone Offhook
Enter: 11
Execute, Abort New Task
A0: Variable Clear [ Name:%RECORDING ]
A1: Notify [ Title:Record Call Text: Icon: Number: Permanent: ]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Notes:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>None&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Profile 2. Record Call&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tasker description:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Profile: Record call
Event: Notification Click
Enter: Record Call
Execute, Abort New Task
A0: Notify Cancel [ Title:Record Call Warn Not Exist: ]
A1: Variable Set [ Name:%RECORDING To:1 Do Maths: Append: ]
A2: In-Call Volume [ Level:5 Display: Sound: ]
A3: Speakerphone [ Set:On ]
A4: Flash [ Text:Started Recording Long: ]
A5: Notify [ Title:Stop Record Call Text: Icon: Number: Permanent: ]
A6: Record Audio [ File:shantz/call-%CNUM-%CDATE-%CTIME Source:Microphone MaxSize: ]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Notes: **&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note the steps A2, A3 and A6. Basically Nexus one has a limitation that you cannot record directly from the call streams. So, I’m doing the recording from the microphone and this works best if the phone is in speakerphone mode. So, I’m turning up the call volume and setting speakerphone mode in A2 and A3 respectively. You can try tweaking these 2 steps (having different call volumes and not engaging speakerphone mode and you might have passable results without doing these as well). Also, try using “Call”, “Incoming Call”, “Outgoing Call” etc as sources in step A6 instead of microphone to check if your phone supports direct call stream recording. If it does, then you will have excellent recording quality and you can also remove steps A2 and A3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Profile 3. Stop Record Call&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tasker description:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Profile: Stop record call
Event: Notification Click
Enter: Stop Record Call
Execute, Abort New Task
A0: Record Audio Stop [ ]
A1: Notify Cancel [ Title:Record Call Warn Not Exist: ]
A2: Notify Cancel [ Title:Stop Record Call Warn Not Exist: ]
A3: Flash [ Text:Stopped Recording Long: ]
A4: Variable Clear [ Name:%RECORDING ]
A5: Speakerphone [ Set:Off ]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Notes: **&lt;/p>
&lt;p>None&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Profile 4. Call Complete&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tasker description:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Profile: Call complete
Event: Phone Idle
Enter: Stop Record Call
Execute, Abort New Task
A0: Record Audio Stop [ ]
A1: Notify Cancel [ Title:Record Call Warn Not Exist: ]
A2: Notify Cancel [ Title:Stop Record Call Warn Not Exist: ]
A3: Flash [ Text:Stopped Recording Long: ]
A4: Variable Clear [ Name:%RECORDING ]
A5: Speakerphone [ Set:Off ]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Notes: **&lt;/p>
&lt;p>None&lt;/p>

But like most other announcements of new things, this one was met as well with as much criticism as the praise it got. A lot of the criticism is FUD though, although mostly unintentional and caused by ignorance of some facts behind it. I’ll try to address some of these concerns here to the best of my knowledge from what I’ve been reading over the past some time about this development.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>An application review process was &lt;a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/2010/09/20/announcing-the-ubuntu-application-review-process/">announced today&lt;/a> for getting your apps into Ubuntu “extras” repository. But like most other announcements of new things, this one was met as well with as much criticism as the praise it got. A lot of the criticism is FUD though, although mostly unintentional and caused by ignorance of some facts behind it. I’ll try to address some of these concerns here to the best of my knowledge from what I’ve been reading over the past some time about this development.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before we begin, here are the terms listed out for an app to be eligible for the new repository:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>only new applications that are not present in an existing official Ubuntu repository (such as main/universe) are eligible in this process (e.g a new version of an application in an existing official repository is not eligible). Also no other software can depend on the application being submitted (e.g. development libraries are not eligible), only executable applications (and content that is part of them) are eligible, and not stand-alone content, documentation or media, and applications must be Open Source and available under an OSI approved license.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Now, the concerns that are floating around are many. Some are genuine queries and many are straight attacks dishing out evil conspiracy theories :P. The concerns can be summarised as:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Closed source and paid apps are being given the boot by Ubuntu. They should have allowed them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Why can’t we have updates for existing apps in this repository?&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Why only standalone apps are allowed. Libraries are equally important.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Why should the software be packaged for /opt. This involves more headache for the developers.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Standalone media and content should have been allowed.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Well, to answer these, all you need to understand is the “premise” and concept behind the repository where this software will go and the reasoning behind the review process will unfold itself. The repository governed by this review process is meant to be for “maintainable” pieces of software that would generally go to other universe/main etc repos but couldn’t make it into this release of Ubuntu because the developers were a bit late. This process and feature now gives a chance to the developers to still get their app to public instead of waiting for next release cycle and also allows end-users to use new apps without having to upgrade their version of Ubuntu . There is a separate “partners” repository where closed source and paid apps can go so there is no conflict there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Only allowing standalone apps and not updates and dependencies is so obvious. It would soon go out of hand exponentially if you allowed dependencies since one thing needs another library updated, then that would need another and yet another and so on and before you know it, you would be back at square one, that is upgrading to the next version of Ubuntu itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only thing that I found out of the place was not allowing standalone content but probably they didn’t allow it because such content can be had by end users without a repo easily and would ease the burden of repo maintainers and reviewers by lessening the entries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’d also like to point out that this is just a beginning and the process (and the people behind it) would definitely be maturing from all the feedback they get from the community. Think of it as an alpha release ;). Jono Bacon summed it up very nicely in this comment of his that he made elsewhere:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>this is an &lt;em>experimental&lt;/em> process; it is a work in progress, it will evolve, and the kinks will be ironed out. The process was approved by the Ubuntu Technical Board who are all seasoned Ubuntu developers (Matt Zimmerman, Colin Watson, Martin Pitt, Mark Shuttleworth, and Kees Cook), and much of what you refer to as &amp;ldquo;restrictions&amp;rdquo; were requested by them for the purpose of delivering a nimble process that is stable and secure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be clear: you can think of this process as a &amp;ldquo;light-weight&amp;rdquo; equivalent to our traditional MOTU development process; it is intended to provide a method in which app devs can get content in Ubuntu, whereas our traditional development processes have be orientated around the needs of Operating System integrators.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As such, this is a first step; sure it is not perfect, but I would like to invite you to make it better; I think this would be a more valuable contribution than just ranting about it on here. Our goal is to make Ubuntu better and to make it more attractive to app developers, and this process will evolve and improve (as was made clear throughout the discussion of this).&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So, what do you think about it? I, for one, am pretty excited..&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>The Great Indian $35 Tablet Hoax?</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/09/13/the-great-indian-35-tablet-hoax/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Sep 2010 09:59:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/09/13/the-great-indian-35-tablet-hoax/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://ibnlive.in.com/blogs/jaimonjoseph/326/62006/is-indias--35-laptop--really-indian.html">Another nail in the coffin&lt;/a> before this Android tablet lives to fulfill the Indian kids’ dreams.

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Apparently, google has this clause in it’s developer’s agreement:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>You may also choose to distribute Products for free. If the Product is free, you will not be charged a Transaction Fee. You may not collect future charges from users for copies of the Products that those users were initially allowed to download for free. This is not intended to prevent distribution of free trial versions of the Product with an &amp;ldquo;upsell&amp;rdquo; option to obtain the full version of the Product: Such free trials for Products are encouraged. However, if you want to collect fees after the free trial expires, you must collect all fees for the full version of the Product through the Payment Processor on the Market. In this Agreement, &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; means there are no charges or fees of any kind for use of the Product. All fees received by Developers for Products distributed via the Market must be processed by the Market&amp;rsquo;s Payment Processor.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So, basically, once the app is free, it will always be free unless you create a new “full” version package and put it up on the market. The solution in the above scenario seems to be that the developer now needs to pull down his previously published app (which is now free), change the package component name and then republish the app. Of course, this means that he loses track of all the data and customers currently associated with the app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m not sure whether this is good or bad. From customers’ point of view it looks good and from developers’ point of view it looks bad. I also don’t know whether this also applies to reducing the price and then increasing it as I can’t put up paid apps in the market yet (though this seems to be allowed as I’ve seen reports of apps increasing their prices). Let me know what you think about this clause (and any clarifications about non-free but fluctuating prices would also be welcome)&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Acer TimelineX 4820TG Mini-Review</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/09/06/acer-timelinex-4820tg-review/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Sep 2010 12:18:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/09/06/acer-timelinex-4820tg-review/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a small review of my Acer TimelineX 4820TG that I purchased a few days ago.

Now, I won’t be talking numbers (like CPU/GPU performance etc) because these things are almost same as per the component used and have been covered in various other reviews online. What I’ll concentrate more upon are the things that other reviewers don’t look at, or look at purely from numbers perspective which don’t make sense to an average buyer. Please let me know if I miss something out that you want to know about this laptop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For clarification, I bought the topmost model of the TimelineX 14 incher series which has a core i5 430m with ATi 5650 1 GB graphics. (Other models have i3 only and one has 512mb graphics, while lowest end has only intel HD graphics). I bought it from Croma Retail for a price of 45,999 INR. So, here it goes:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Frame/Overall Build Quality&lt;/strong>: Overall, TimelineX 4820TG “feels” sturdy. It has a brushed metal lid and a plastic bottom. There is some flex all around, especially in the lid area but that is to be expected from a laptop which is so thin. For reference, I compared it to a lot of other laptops with almost similar dimensions, and the build quality and flex was generally on par with all of them, except the Asus Bamboo series and macbooks. I wouldn’t worry too much about it though. It is perfectly luggable through the campus or office, just that I wouldn’t keep anything heavy on top of it (I used to keep a lot of my books and other stuff on top of my previous laptop).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Keyboard&lt;/strong>: 4820TG’skeyboard is chiclet-type but it feels a bit flimsy as compared to the competition. It seems that the keys do not have support all arund but just at the center, so you can see the key edges tilting while typing. Also, the keys are not beveled but flat, which could put off few users though it was not a hindrance for me. Also, the keys feel just a tad bit mushy. But it takes just a few hours to get used to it. Only thing I’m not sure is whether I’ll still feel the same about this keyboard one year from now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Touchpad&lt;/strong>: The touchpad is awesome. It is fairly big compared to what others give you these days. It is also multi-touch and supports the usual gestures like two fingure scroll, pinch-zoom, rotate, etc and I guess you could extend these pretty easily by using appropriate software. The click buttons are rocker-type, i.e., a single bar serves as the two buttons depending on where you press. It’s ok but you have to be slightly more careful than having two separate buttons here as you have to press near the ends for the clicks to register properly. Though this also becomes a second nature after a few hours of use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Weight:&lt;/strong> The notebook is very light. I haven’t measured it on a weighing scale but for the oomph it packs, it is pretty slim and light. I can lift it easily by two fingers without feeling any strain and can work for hours with it sitting on my lap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Heat / Temperature / Noise:&lt;/strong> The heat and noise emission is very low. While browsing and downloading and doing other general stuff, I couldn hardly feel it heating up while on my laps. The left top area on the underside (just near the vents) becomes a bit warm after prolonged use but still it is not unconfortable. The keyboard and wrist/palm rest areas remain cool throughout. I could not hear the fans at all while doing normal work in the dead of night and this turns into a slight whirr when the laptop is tasked with heavier crunching.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Battery Life:&lt;/strong> This is the USP of this model and one of the biggest reason why I went for it. This laptop has switchable graphics, i.e., you can chose to use the onboard intel GMA HD graphics for regular use or multimedia playback (plays HD media beautifully) or switch to the ATi 5650 for heavier tasks like gaming, etc. While using the intel graphics, I could easily browse for around 5 hours. I also downloaded around 500mb of stuff during this time and another 300 mb worth of windows updates were downloaded and installed. Moreover, this was all on normal settings and that too when I had a very poor wi-fi signal. I hadn’t mucked around with any power saving options at all and I believe that doing that, along with dimming the brightness and better wi-fi signal etc would easily pump it over the 6 hour mark. This is not as much as the 8 hours that Acer promises but still, it is excellent and much better than most of the competition. While turning on ATi 5650 for the same type of tasks reduced the battery life to around 3 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Performance:&lt;/strong> I didn’t run any benchmarks on the laptop and neither did I do any gaming, but I didn’t feel any slow downs while doing any normal tasks and 720p/1080p media playback even while using the intel graphics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is it for now. I’ll keep updating it as more things come to my mind. I hope I have touched upon the significant aspects that I found missing when I was searching around for reviews of this laptop. Let me know if you have any queries for it and I’ll surely update it. Also, I haven’t gone into too much details as I’m primarily a linux user and haven’t explored or tasked this laptop too much till now. I’ll also be installing Ubuntu Maverick Meerkat on this asap and blog about this laptop’s linux compatibility, issues, fixes and workarounds as well.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Solving The Android Permissions And Malware Puzzle</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/08/13/android-permissions-malware/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2010 19:44:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/08/13/android-permissions-malware/</guid><description>&lt;p>There has been a spate of security reports recently about Android apps being malware or suspicious.

Most of these were found baseless but at least one was indeed correct (e.g. The Russian Trojan app). We also know that Android has a very good &lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/2010/06/26/android-vs-iphone-security-models.html">security model&lt;/a> but even then, the rest of the reports also makes one think and focus on why an apps requires the permissions that it states it needs?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We all MUST check the permissions that an app requires before installing it and then contemplate what particular feature of the app would require any mentioned permission. The problem here is two part. First is that the permissions can be cryptic. Now, I can understand most of these as I also develop Android apps but I&amp;rsquo;d fathom that a huge majority wouldn&amp;rsquo;t. A simple solution to this would be for Google to provide more details (and probably examples) for each permission. One can say that it is difficult and a UI nightmare to include too much of text into the limited space that the mobile screen gets. My suggestion here would be to keep the existing layout as it is, but when someone clicks on a requested permission, he be taken to a new page which describes the permission in detailed but simple words and also provides examples.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But this is just the first part of the current problem. The more important issue most apps are facing these days is &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>permission creep in&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;, i.e., they request for permissions they don&amp;rsquo;t really require. This could be because either they are just adding it to their manifest file mistakenly without using them or are taking a long route for solving a problem that should ideally have been solved in a much easier way without requiring excessive permissions. This permission creep in makes even legit apps look bad. e.g. There was this recent case of a &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/29/android-wallpaper-hack/">wallpaper app&lt;/a> which was crucified by mainstream media all over the world because of the permissions it was using and then it turned out to be just that the developer&amp;rsquo;s method to solve a particular problem (providing &amp;ldquo;favorites&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;recommended&amp;rdquo; features to users) was long-winded. This is quite common today in Android marketplace. e.g. I tried to install the hugely famous &amp;ldquo;Chomp SMS&amp;rdquo; app today and noticed that it requires my &amp;ldquo;location&amp;rdquo; as well. Pretty weird that an SMS app needs my location and when combined with the &amp;ldquo;Internet&amp;rdquo; permission that it requires as well, it made me go &amp;ldquo;hmmm&amp;rdquo; even though it is tried and tested by a huge number of people without issues. Then I realized that it might need the internet permission for ads (since I was downloading the free version) but still a bit doubtful about location, probably that is needed for ads targeting (especially because it wanted my coarse location only, i.e., cell-triangulation location by which it can easily identify my general region or country, which is all what is needed) but I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure. Even the Android Guru &lt;a href="http://commonsware.com/blog/2010/08/12/evernote-why-you-need-think-about-permissions.html">Mark Murphy has similar reservations&lt;/a> about another popular app Evernote.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The solution? I think Google should make it mandatory for app publishers to explain in the market that why their app needs each of the permissions it requests. This should be concisely explained to the user before installation and then the user-review feature of Android marketplace can take over to determine whether the explanation given is indeed satisfactory enough or not. This would, e.g., make it immediately clear to any potential Chomp SMS users why it needs the location. I&amp;rsquo;m sure this would lead to even more sales for the good and trusted apps as people like me who were skeptical of something can put their doubts to rest. At the same time, it would quickly push the russian trojan like apps down into the oblivion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A side effect/benefit of this approach will also be that the app authors would look at the permissions that they use more cautiously and would probably try to weed out the unnecessary ones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another idea that I have in mind is more community based. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if Google will implement the above idea or even if they do, would they make it mandatory since market already has almost a 100,000 apps without this info. BUT, if someone can take up the mantle of making a community site that documents, with the help of android users, the potential uses of all apps&amp;rsquo; permissions and also raise flags on any app having a permission without any apparent need, this would become a boon to the Android users. AppBrain, are you listening? I think this would be a good addition to your already excellent service.&lt;/p>

This happens even if they support all android versions and have published their apps for all countries, so that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the issue. I came across this as well when few people mentioned that they couldn&amp;rsquo;t find my app Wi-Fi Keep Alive in the X10 mini marketplace. On some digging into the android docs and the X10 mini specs, I found the issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem is that the X10 mini has a very small screen with only a QVGA resolution. This screen size/resolution wasn&amp;rsquo;t supported by Android until recently and the Android system might not be able to scale resources and layouts designed for other screen sizes well enough to suit the X10 mini. Hence, the Android system designers have chosen that any app which does not declare explicit support for small screens (i.e., the app dev has tested his app on small screens and made any changes, if needed, and then declared that everything works fine in the Android Manifest) then it is considered not compatible by default and hence, the Android marketplace will filter your app out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, this is a big loss. A lot of X10 minis were sold and there are lot of new low-tier and cheap Android smartphones coming out with this resolution, so it is a significant market share that you can&amp;rsquo;t afford to lose. The solution is simple. If the app does indeed work fine on small screens (or you have fixed it to work), then all you got to do is add the below mentioned line in your AndroidManifest.xml:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>&amp;lt;supports-screens android:smallScreens=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s it. Your app should now show up fine in all screen sizes markets. Note that for all other screen sizes and resolutions, Android considers the default support as true and your app will show in those markets even if you don&amp;rsquo;t make any explicit declarations for them. You can read more about this here: &lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html">Supporting Multiple Screens in Android&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Update: **&lt;a href="http://www.blundell-apps.com/">Blundell&lt;/a> pointed out in the comments that &lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html%23defaults">Android documentation&lt;/a> says&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>If android:minSdkVersion or android:targetSdkVersion is &amp;ldquo;4&amp;rdquo; (Android 1.6) or higher, the default value for everything is true. If your application requires Android 1.6 features, but does not support these densities and/or screen sizes, you need to set the appropriate attributes to false.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This should mean that small screens should be set as supported by default if you have your minSdk &lt;strong>or&lt;/strong> targetSdk   set to anything above or equal to 4. However, in my case, my apps had minSdk as 3 but targetSdk as 7 or 8 but still they didn&amp;rsquo;t show up in X10 mini marketplace till I added the smallScreens support to true in my manifest file. If anyone has any ideas about as to why it was like this, please let me know.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>SSH Tunneling On Android</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/08/02/ssh-tunneling-android/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2010 10:53:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/08/02/ssh-tunneling-android/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you want to have a secure browsing environment or just want to access your home network securely without exposing extra services to the internet and without the mess that comes with setting up and maintaining a VPN server, ssh tunneling is your rescuer.

In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you how to setup an ssh tunnel to your home network easily. Also look for some bonus tips at the end ;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This article assumes that you have already installed and setup a ssh server (you can probably use openssh). Also, it assumes that the ssh server is accessible from the internet (i.e. you have appropriately forwarded the port on which ssh server is running). I&amp;rsquo;d also recommend that if you do not have a static IP for your home network, then sign up for a dynamic DNS service (I use dyndns.org) so that you can access your home network easily by using a domain name (e.g. myserver.dyndns.org) from outside.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, here is a step by step guide on what to do on your Android Phone (I&amp;rsquo;m doing this on a Nexus one but should be same for you as well):&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Install an app called &amp;ldquo;connectbot&amp;rdquo; from the android marketplace. It is a FREE ssh client for android.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Open it and add the IP (or dynamic domain name as suggested above) and the port on which ssh server is running to the bottom and connect.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/ssh-tunnel-1-thumb.png" alt="Android SSH Tunnel 1">&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>Once connected, press the menu button and select the icon which says &amp;ldquo;Port Forwards&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/ssh-tunnel-2-thumb.png" alt="Android SSH Tunnel 2">&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>On this screen you can configure the ports to be used for tunneling. As you can see I already have my firefly server port configured for music streaming over itunes&amp;rsquo; DAAP protocol. Now, you can press &amp;ldquo;menu&amp;rdquo; button and click on &amp;ldquo;Add ports&amp;rdquo; and go to step 5.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/ssh-tunnel-3-thumb.png" alt="Android SSH Tunnel 3">&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="5">
&lt;li>You will see the dialog box as shown below. Here you can configure mainly two types of ports.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/ssh-tunnel-4-thumb.png" alt="Android SSH Tunnel 4">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>5a) First is for services that you want to access already running on your home network. e.g. in my case, I have a firefly media server (mt-daapd) running on a port &amp;ldquo;12345&amp;rdquo; and I want to access this just like I was on LAN over my home wi-fi. In such a case, select &amp;ldquo;type&amp;rdquo; as &amp;ldquo;Local&amp;rdquo;, source port as , say &amp;ldquo;56000&amp;rdquo; and destination as &amp;ldquo;ip:port&amp;rdquo; where ip is the your home local area IP of the machine on which the server is running (My server runs on router itself, which has IP 192.168.1.1) and the port is the actual port on which server is running (e.g. 12345 as we mentioned above). After doing this, just open the respective client app on your phone which wants to connect to this server and enter &amp;ldquo;127.0.0.1&amp;rdquo; as the ip and &amp;ldquo;56000&amp;rdquo; as the port to connect to and it will connect to server as if you were on your home network even over 3G or your office wi-fi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>5b) Secondly, you can use this tunnel to route all traffic to internet through home connection. For this, choose the type as &amp;ldquo;dynamic&amp;rdquo; and source port as, say, &amp;quot; 56001&amp;quot;. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to select a destination port here because any traffic that comes over this tunnel will be routed back to the internet using the destination ip and port as desired, e.g., specified in a browser&amp;rsquo;s address bar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Bonus: **As I promised above, here is the bonus. For media streaming, you can use mt-daapd or firefly server on your home network, especially on a router like asus wl-500 or any other hackable router with custom firmware. For more info about how to set it up, you can check these posts:&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/2009/07/03/compiling-latest-firefly-mt-daapd-asus-wl-500w.html"> Latest Firefly server for your router&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/2010/07/26/firefly-sqlite-error-unable-to-open-database-file-solution.html">firefly sqlite error solution&lt;/a>.   For android side things, install the &amp;ldquo;DAAP Client&amp;rdquo; app from the market place and click on &amp;ldquo;Add server&amp;rdquo; option and follow step 4a as mentioned above. And there it is, your own music streaming service anywhere in the world, over edge/3G or any other network :)&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Camera LED As Flashlight on Non-Rooted Android Phones</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/07/30/camera-led-flashlight-non-rooted-android-phones/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2010 09:31:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/07/30/camera-led-flashlight-non-rooted-android-phones/</guid><description>&lt;p>We all know that Android does not allow the camera LED to be controlled directly from apps and hence, you cannot use the camera LED as a Torch or Flashlight unless you are rooted.

But after doing all the installation and reconfiguration, it gave me a weird error &amp;ldquo;unable to open database file&amp;rdquo; every time and exited. I checked the permissions on the songs3.db file (in /opt/var/cache/mt-daapd for me) and made it writable by all but the issue persisted. I changed its ownership to the user under which firefly was running but the issue was still there. Finally I found that the server (or maybe its an sqlite thing) was trying to create a temp file in the cache directory for the transactions and since the user with which it was started, didn&amp;rsquo;t own the directory it wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to create the file in it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, the fix: I did a &lt;code>chown &amp;lt;username&amp;gt; /opt/var/cache/mt-daapd&lt;/code> on it and voila! the problem was fixed. I am a happy man now since I own a new android phone since last time and now able to stream all my music to my phone through itunes (daap protocol) server over an ssh tunnel :)&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Android App Wi-Fi Keep Alive updated to 1.4.1</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/07/22/android-app-wi-fi-keep-alive-updated-1-4-0/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2010 16:58:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/07/22/android-app-wi-fi-keep-alive-updated-1-4-0/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update:&lt;/strong> Made a minor update for a small bug that can make wi-fi keep reconnecting in quick succession.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pushed out a new update to my Android App Wi-Fi Keep Alive today. This update brings in another work around for the issue where the wi-fi is alive on the phone and it is also connected to the network but is somehow unable to send/receive any packets to the network. The new work around will automatically re-associate your phone with the wi-fi router if it detects such a situation. This seems to make it work properly again for sometime. When it fails again, the workaround kicks in automatically again. This is not an ideal &amp;ldquo;fix&amp;rdquo; as such because streaming apps like Pandora radio etc might have a hiccup because of this but it is unavoidable as of now and atleast the notifications for mails and other things etc will work fine because this state stops even the mobile data network from taking over since the phone perceives that wi-fi is connected but is not working actually.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update:&lt;/strong> Made a minor update for a small bug that can make wi-fi keep reconnecting in quick succession.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The other things include support for small screen devices like Xperia X10 mini, some optimizations for size and speed, some icon sizes and UI tweaks for compatibility with different screen sizes and android versions.

I moved to a new location which was totally jam-packed with other wi-fi networks using same channel as mine which was hampeing my connection. I tried for umpteen number of times. Changing the channel through the web configuration did not give any error but I found that it was still transmitting at channel 1. I confirmed by checking on the &amp;ldquo;Status &amp;amp; Log&amp;rdquo; page, checking the logs, and running &amp;ldquo;wl status&amp;rdquo; command through ssh and they all confirmed that it was transmitting at channel 1 only, no matter what I set it to in the configuration. I even opened an issue in the firmware project for the custom firmware (by oleg and lly) that I am using but they weren&amp;rsquo;t able to help me as the wi-fi drivers are binary only.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>Recently I found an issue with my asus wl-500w wi-fi router that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to change the channel on which it was transmitting.

&lt;p>But by sheer chance, I stumbled upon the solution finally by trial and error. The solution is that you should set the &amp;ldquo;Bandwidth&amp;rdquo; to 20 MHz in wi-fi configuration if you are using 802.11 G. If you set it to 40 MHz then it gets stuck somehow but as soon as I changed it to 20 MHz, I was able to see the channel change immediately after reboot. Here is the screenshot of the page where you can find this setting.&lt;/p>

Here is how:&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>Skype on linux works great but the problem that I faced was that it does not handle the buttons on the bluetooth headsets. My wife uses skype to call into her work related conference calls and was pretty frustrated that she had to keep sitting in front of my laptop (her laptop didn&amp;rsquo;t allow to install skype) just to switch mute on and off. So, I whipped up this little trick to do so. Here is how:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>First I looked at the skype API (pretty simple, based on dbus). Also found a sample script somewhere that allowed to answer and hang up calls through skype API.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Modified the script to switch the mute on and off instead of answering/hanging up. Script can be downloaded at the end of this article. You can also modify it to take some other action that you want.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Install &amp;ldquo;blueman&amp;rdquo;. If you are using Ubuntu, just type &amp;ldquo;sudo apt-get install blueman&amp;rdquo; in shell.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Once blueman is installed and you have done your headset pairing etc, right click on the blueman icon in the system tray and click on &amp;ldquo;Local Services&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>In local services, click on headset tab and you can see a input box where you can give the path of a program/script which will be run whenever the &amp;ldquo;answer button&amp;rdquo; on the headset is pressed. This is important to note that blueman only supports the answer button and nothing else and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the inclination to develop a full-fledged AVRCP compliant program to capture other buttons as all I was interested in mute functionality. You can see the screenshot of this below:&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/blueman-skype-bluetooth-mute-button.png">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/blueman-skype-bluetooth-mute-button-thumb.png" alt="Skype Headset Button Settings for Blueman">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="6">
&lt;li>Make sure that you give the path where you saved the script that you downloaded in step 4 and you are all set now. Make a call and click on the answer button of your headset to see the magic happen :P&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Let me know if you have your own hacks like this or know of a way to have a full fledged capturing of all headset buttons.&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>It isn’t apparent immediately that what is causing this error. The very first line in the code “Context mContext = getApplicationContext();” is the culprit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Solution:&lt;/strong> Just replace “getApplicationContext()” with “this” (i.e. “Context mContext = this;” ) and it will work fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Explanation:&lt;/strong> As to why this is exactly an issue, I’m a bit fuzzy about it myself but this much I’m sure that the contexts that you get with getApplicationContext and this are different. On reading about this function from Android SDK help:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Return the context of the single, global Application object of the current process. This generally should only be used if you need a Context whose lifecycle is separate from the current context, that is tied to the lifetime of the process rather than the current component.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I think this would mean is that getApplicationContext returns a context which is for the application itself and not the activity, while “this” would give you the context of the activity in which you are creating the dialog. I think since it is the activity which is associated with the UI (and for whom the window has been created), using the application context would have caused the crash here.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Android App: Wi-Fi Keep Alive Updated to 1.2.0</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/07/03/android-app-wi-fi-keep-alive-updated-to-1-2-0/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jul 2010 22:46:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/07/03/android-app-wi-fi-keep-alive-updated-to-1-2-0/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just finished uploading the new version 1.2.0 of my android app Wi-Fi Keep Alive to the Android market.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Latest Version:&lt;/strong> 1.4.4 (See below for change log history)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Are you frustrated by your downloads getting broken or worse, switching over to slow and expensive mobile data connections like GPRS/Edge/3G when your wi-fi connection gets dropped by your Android phone when the screen goes off? If yes, then look no further. Here is my app that allows you to choose your desired Wi-Fi Sleep policy. You can choose from the following options:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Default -&amp;gt; This means that wi-fi will turn off whenever the screen goes off.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Wi-Fi On on sleep if plugged -&amp;gt; This means that if your phone is plugged into a USB slot or wall charger, then wi-fi will not turn off even when the screen goes off.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Wi-Fi Never goes off -&amp;gt; This means that your wi-fi will not shut down whenever screen turns off, even if you are not plugged into USB/charger.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Please note that this app just changes the sleep policy and does not change the wi-fi state by itself. You can still control wi-fi turning on/off manually.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Few folks were having issues with their devices that the inbuilt handling of this wi-fi sleep policy in their phones wasn&amp;rsquo;t being done properly by Android. To take care of this, there are a few workarounds added to the app now which can be accessed by clicking on &amp;ldquo;Advanced Options&amp;rdquo; on the configuration screen (This configuration screen can be accessed by launching the app or it will also show up whenever you add a widget). Enable any one or all of the workarounds mentioned in advanced settings depending on what works best on your device as there are lot of variants due to different manufacturers and different Android versions on different phones. Please also note that you should enable these workarounds only if the app is not working fully well for you without enabling them as some of them can cause your battery to drain a bit faster.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another thing to note is that I&amp;rsquo;ve added a widget for it. So, you can install the app and instead of having to open the app and change the setting every time, you can just add its widget to your home screen (Long press on home screen. Then choose Widgets-&amp;gt;Wi-Fi Keep Alive). Now, you can just touch it whenever you want to change your setting and it will automatically cycle through the options listed above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dark/Sepia Widget Icon -&amp;gt; Default setting&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Purple Widget Icon -&amp;gt; Wi-Fi On on sleep if plugged&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Green Widget -&amp;gt; Wi-Fi never goes off&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please try it out and let me know if you face any issues or have any suggestions :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Known Issues:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>1) Known issue with &amp;ldquo;on when plugged in&amp;rdquo; policy is that if you are already plugged in while changing anything in the app, workarounds don&amp;rsquo;t take place until you plug out and plug in again&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**2) **This is not a known issue with the app but with wi-fi on some devices itself that it stops working on leaving it idle even if the phone is not sleeping. This is not the purview of this particular app and it might not solve it, although few folks say that this app helps in this scenario as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**3) **Some routers/settings are also known to cause issues with wi-fi in sleep. The correct pattern has not been identified yet but many people report that they can stay connected to wi-fi in sleep with some routers but with other routers, it fails. (Work Around 3 might help in such cases but not always)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**4) **While adding widget, the main app screen will pop-up for widget configuration. You need to choose any one policy (even if desired one already selected) otherwise widget will not be added&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Notes:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**1) **Please press Menu key in the app and select &amp;ldquo;Help&amp;rdquo; to see details about policy and workaround options.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**2) **Please report any bugs here along with these details so that i can fix the issues:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i) Device/Phone Name and Rom version&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ii) What is the app version that you have? (latest is 1.2.1)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>iii) Did you try turning on all combinations of workarounds in advanced options?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>iv) Can you please enable logging in the advanced options and send me logcat dump for this duration, preferably with all workarounds enabled.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Changelog:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A. I don&amp;rsquo;t guarantee this post to be absolutely correct as I&amp;rsquo;m no security researcher or expert but I do have some interest in this field and I&amp;rsquo;ve been a developer for some time now on different architectures and OSs especially at OS/driver level and that too in the mobile devices field, so I &amp;ldquo;might&amp;rdquo; actually be right about a few things here and there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>B. I&amp;rsquo;m an android user myself but not of the fanboy variety. I&amp;rsquo;ll be happy to switch camps any day I get something that appeals to me better. I have love and hate points for almost all platforms available but I&amp;rsquo;m using android because &amp;ldquo;for me&amp;rdquo; it&amp;rsquo;s love points slightly outnumber the hate points.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OK, on with the points then. Here is the table that I created for this showing points I considered and which side wins each. Don&amp;rsquo;t start flaming me though just by seeing the table :P I will be discussing the points as well below it.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="1-distribution-medium-security">1. Distribution Medium Security:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Apple vets every application that is put on the app store while Google&amp;rsquo;s Market Place is unrestricted. How does this affect you security wise?&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="a-approval-process">a. Approval Process&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The biggest myth is that the vetting process is what will save you from malware on app store. IT WON&amp;rsquo;T. The Apple app approval process isn&amp;rsquo;t defined anywhere but in general it just states that it checks for apps to do what they say they will do. But they don&amp;rsquo;t check the source code of the apps and static analysis of binaries can only take you so far (Heck, they have even been inept at catching a whole lot of apps that were using their disallowed private apis which can be found easily using simple tools) . So, anyone actually wanting to write a malware can do it trivially by making the malicious code to run after the app has been approved. The trigger could be time based or could even be done over the web remotely. The app could even have encrypted payloads or download new pieces of code over the web and run them. So, we can safely say that approval process is something that can&amp;rsquo;t make things secure for you that way.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="b-phishing">b. Phishing&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>This is where App store can protect you if someone put an app claiming to be from someone that it isn&amp;rsquo;t. e.g. Someone could make an app that claims to be from &amp;ldquo;Bank of America&amp;rdquo;. In apple&amp;rsquo;s case, I&amp;rsquo;m 99.99% sure that the app won&amp;rsquo;t pass the screening but in Android&amp;rsquo;s case, there won&amp;rsquo;t be any hassles for it to reach the marketplace. It could be pulled soon after as google learns about it but still even one person&amp;rsquo;s damage here is much more than what would have happened on iPhone.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="2-local-security">2. Local Security:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>What about the security in the OS itself once an app is on your phone? This is an important question because 1.) As I noted above, Apple&amp;rsquo;s app screening process isn&amp;rsquo;t robust enough to catch malware 2.) People can bypass the official distribution medium easily. Android allows to install apps from other sources on most phones by just enabling an option and a huge number of people jailbreak their iPhones and get/use this capability.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="a-permissions">a. Permissions&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>On Android, an app has to explicitly declare what capabilities/data of the phone it wants to access/use and the user has to explicitly give it those permissions before it is allowed to install, irrespective of from where/how this app is being installed. So, it works even if you are installing the app from your SD card and even if you have rooted your phone. On iPhone, there is no such mechanism of restricting apps. All apps are equal and can access a lot of resources unhindered without the user knowing. So, while installing a single player only game on android you can immediately be suspicious if the app is asking for internet connection or access to your contacts data but on iPhone you will not come to know about this.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="b-environment">b. Environment&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>On both platforms, the apps run in their own sandboxes with unique uuids&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="3-open-vs-closed">3. Open vs Closed:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Most of the Android code is open source while for iOS, only darwin kernel and some other things like webkit etc are open source. Now, this in itself doesn&amp;rsquo;t guarantee to make Android secure but its code does get a lot of scrutiny from open source community as well as lot of other big name companies with commercial interests in Android which allows it to find and fix more bugs and loopholes than iPhone can.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="4-app-development-model">4. App Development Model:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Most apps for Android are written in java while those in iPhone are written in C/Objective-C. While I&amp;rsquo;m myself a big time C lover (Majority of my coding is in C/CPP) but it is indeed a very unforgiving language where you need to be very careful with what you write and has much greater chances of exploits, .e.g, Buffer overflows, as compared to java (Interestingly, all the jailbreaks for iPhone OS have been done using such exploits and have been made available day 0/day 1 mostly.)&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="5-damage-control">5. Damage Control:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>What if an app actually got through everything on any of these platforms and started spreading? Both of these platforms have kill switches in the hands of Google/Apple which they can use to remove such malicious apps from the users&amp;rsquo; phones remotely.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="summary">Summary:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Well, there is no clear winner. Apple is quite good when it comes to protecting you from phishing (though that advantage goes away if you jailbreak and use alternative means to install apps) and Android has a real sound local security system (though it also has the flaw that users might not always understand why an app is requesting a certain critical permission and install it anyways). So, take your pick and let me know what you picked :) and please do tell me if I&amp;rsquo;m wrong in any of my points or missed out on something that needs to be compared.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>How To Debug Android Widgets</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/06/13/how-to-debug-android-widgets/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jun 2010 18:42:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/06/13/how-to-debug-android-widgets/</guid><description>&lt;p>For most new android app developers (like me), it is a bit puzzling how to debug the android widgets or how to put a breakpoint in an android widget code. For normal applications, it is quite simple as when you press &amp;ldquo;debug&amp;rdquo; on the eclipse toolbar, it launches the emulator (or connects to existing emulator/device), syncs your application and launches its main activity and puts the control in your hands if you have put a breakpoint. For widgets, it seems a bit tricky because there is no activity to be launched, so eclipse just syncs your widget&amp;rsquo;s apk and installs it and that&amp;rsquo;s it. So, is it possible or not to debug widget code? and if yes, then is it very difficult? Fortunately, it is possible and very easy to do but just slightly less intuitive and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any information about it at Android developers website and learnt it by just fumbling around for a few minutes so thought of posting here for the benefit of other newbies like me.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>For most new android app developers (like me), it is a bit puzzling how to debug the android widgets or how to put a breakpoint in an android widget code.

Fortunately, it is possible and very easy to do but just slightly less intuitive and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any information about it at Android developers website and learnt it by just fumbling around for a few minutes so thought of posting here for the benefit of other newbies like me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, all you need to debug your widget code is almost same as what you do for normal applications. Just follow the below steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Press &amp;ldquo;debug&amp;rdquo; on the eclipse menu (or &amp;ldquo;run&amp;rdquo; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to matter)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Once the widget apk is sync&amp;rsquo;ed and installed onto your emulator/device, switch your eclipse workspace to DDMS mode. You can either do this by pressing the &amp;ldquo;DDMS&amp;rdquo; labeled button on your top right corner or if you can&amp;rsquo;t find it, then do it by going to &amp;ldquo;Window-&amp;gt;Open Perspective-&amp;gt;DDMS&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Select the process name of your widget from the list of processes shown. By default, this list appears at top left of DDMS window. (See screenshot below). If you can&amp;rsquo;t see your widget&amp;rsquo;s process name in the list, it is possible that the widget is not added to the home screen yet. So, do so.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Press the green debug button above the process list (See screenshot below)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>And that&amp;rsquo;s it. Now, if you had put a breakpoint in the code, do something that executes that piece of the code.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

We all need to disable the sync settings of a particular account sometimes  but keep all other items still syncing. For example, for most of the day I&amp;rsquo;m at work, in front of my office PC so I don&amp;rsquo;t need to keep my work email syncing which causes unnecessary drain on my battery but I do need to keep other things, like my google calendar, syncing still. Now, the power control widget that comes with android is a bit too coarse for this use as it presents a situation of all or none. So, if you use the power control widget, it either disables syncing entirely for all your apps or enables it for all of them. So, you have to manually go into accounts and sync settings and turn off syncing for the account you want but it takes too many clicks (You first long hold on menu, then press settings, then scroll to account settings, then click on it to open it). So, instead of that, you can just use this app here. Install and add a shortcut to the home screen. Whenever you need, just click on it and it will open the accounts and sync settings screen for you immediately without any fuss.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>This is a very small android app to open the accounts and sync settings in one click.

&lt;p>The app is very light and consumes no resources and exits immediately leaving no background processes behind. Please try it out and let me know if you like it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To install, either search for &amp;ldquo;Quick Sync Settings&amp;rdquo; in the android market or you can just scan the below given QR code from the barcode scanner app on your phone.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>PS: I&amp;rsquo;m also developing another app which will allow you to directly control the sync on/off for any account (with fine control also available for each item within each account like mail/calendar/contacts separately) through a power control like widget. It is working for me right now but I&amp;rsquo;m fixing it around the edges so that I can publish a relatively force-close-free app for you :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>NOTE: Quick Sync Settings works only on Android 2.1 and above and you would be unable to find it in the android marketplace if your android version is less than that (Android marketplace automatically filters out apps which are not compatible with your version)&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Apple is Magical: Daniel Eran Gilder is the Living Proof</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/06/10/apple-magical-dan-eran-gilder/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jun 2010 04:49:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/06/10/apple-magical-dan-eran-gilder/</guid><description>&lt;p>Update: Removed the post as the person in consideration has contacted me with the explanation of what went down.

&lt;p>**UPDATED: **&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>27-MAY-2010 (Added things missing since Eclair and few other notes)&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>25-MAY-2010 (Added market missing apps fix, 802.11n and other features)&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>24-MAY-2010 (Added more un-announced features/fixes/changes)&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>To start with, just a quick recap of things that were announced and their look/feel/working in real use (First is the announced feature and then after &amp;ldquo;:&amp;rdquo; is the effect that we see)&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Feature/Fix&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Real Effects seen by us&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Remarks&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>JIT for Dalvik JVM&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Apps are quite fast, visible difference animation effects, scrolling, games etc&lt;/td>
&lt;td>None&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Better Exchange support with calendar sync/GAL /remote wipe/account-auto-discovery/administation&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Works as advertised&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Exchange support still not upto the mark. e.g. No support for selective folder sync, subfolders are not synced automatically, no phone number/location for GAL contacts, no &amp;ldquo;move to folder&amp;rdquo;, no search, etc.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Backup Application data/settings/history in cloud&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Yet to experience&lt;/td>
&lt;td>I&amp;rsquo;ve enabled the settings for this but haven&amp;rsquo;t switched to another ROM yet or figured out how to test it in some other way.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Cloud Messaging to activate intents&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Works as advertised&lt;/td>
&lt;td>very cool feature. Try out this chrome extension to send links from chrome to your phone: &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/chrometophone/">Chrome2Phone&lt;/a>&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>USB Tethering and Portable Wireless Hotspot&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Works as advertised&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Real skin-saver. Works great and easily.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Javascript V8 Engine for Android Browser&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Much faster javascript execution&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Much better browsing experience noted.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>HTML5 support/Device Access (Camera/Accelerometer etc) through Browser&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Work In Progress. See Remarks&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Contrary to what many people tell you, this is still not there. HTML5 support is an ongoing thing and device access through browser would be present in Gingerbread (Next Android iteration, supposedly 3.0)&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Better Voice Input Integration&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&amp;ldquo;Seems&amp;rdquo; better.&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Now, I don&amp;rsquo;t have any tangible means to measure this but it seems to be working relatively better and it even seems to understand my non-US accent much better.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Flash 10.1 beta support&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Works as advertised&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Almost every flash functionality in all sites I visited work ok. Please note that you need to install Flash from market as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t come &amp;ldquo;built-in&amp;rdquo;. Just search for &amp;ldquo;Adobe&amp;rdquo; in market.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Install apps on SD card&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Not tested.&lt;/td>
&lt;td>This feature requires support from apps to integrate this and currently no apps support it. There is a command that you can run from adb shell &amp;ldquo;adb shell pm setInstallLocation 2&amp;rdquo; but it will cause &amp;ldquo;all&amp;rdquo; your apps to install to the card plus users report problems on missing apps as SD card is not available immediately at boot up.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Better global search integration for apps&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Works as advertised&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Now, apps can allow search to search within their data. Right now the official twitter app supports this and you can search your timeline from the main android search itself.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Update all apps in one click/automatic updates&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Works as advertised&lt;/td>
&lt;td>None.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Stream music from PC to phone&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Yet to test.&lt;/td>
&lt;td>None. As pointed out by Hugo, it is not clear yet that this is supposed to be part of Froyo or GingerBread.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Improved crash reporting to developers&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Works as advertised&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Really useful to the developers as it sends complete report about the environment and stack trace etc.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Purchase music/apps on android market and push directly to device Over The Air&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Yet to test&lt;/td>
&lt;td>New market website that allows this hasn&amp;rsquo;t appeared yet. As pointed out by Hugo, it is not clear yet that this is supposed to be part of Froyo or GingerBread.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Now, we move on to things that weren&amp;rsquo;t announced but we found them in the updates. This may be because these pieces were too small or specific to nexus one to have warranted a place in the Google I/O keynote.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Feature/Fix&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Remarks&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Erratic/Crazy Touchscreen behaviour fixes&lt;/td>
&lt;td>This is about the erratic behaviour of the touchscreen that sometimes all the touches were being registered at the wrong places and one had to tap twice on the power button to fix it. So far, it seems that this has been fixed.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Multi-touch fixes&lt;/td>
&lt;td>This seems to be a hardware problem and there are no &amp;ldquo;fixes&amp;rdquo; to it as such but there seems to be a new touchscreen API in the 2.2 Froyo SDK that google is encouraging developers to use to alleviate this issue somewhat by doing some filtering/scaling within the Android framework.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>SMS App fix&lt;/td>
&lt;td>The messaging app had a nagging issue that many times it showed the first few words of a text message as the sender instead of the actual number/sender. This seems to be fixed now.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Capacitive Touch Button fix&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Nexus one was quite famous for its mal-functioning cap-touch buttons that didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to register the touches of a user. We had to press slightly above them most times to register a touch. This seems to be fixed now and feels much better.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Multi-Color Trackball&lt;/td>
&lt;td>The nexus one trackball can now display multiple colors instead of just white. e.g. a nee facebook update received makes it glow blue :)&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Better Camera/Gallery Interface&lt;/td>
&lt;td>The new camera/gallery interface is just awesome and much easier to use. Feature wise I think the new options are focus settings, zoom settings and storage location quick switch, flash on during video recording for night video capture. I must also mention that auto-flash works much better now as earlier it used to almost always fire even in quite ample light but that maybe just me.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Bigger Camera Pics&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Somehow the pics are a bit heavier in size. Earlier a max resolution, finest pic used to weigh around 900-950 kB for me but now they are around 1.09-1.1 MB&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Keyboard Quick Access to numbers/punctuation&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Now, you don’t need to switch to the number mode by pressing “123?” key to input number/punctutation. Just press anywhere on the keyboard and drag it towards the preview/suggestion bar upwards and two new rows will appear with numbers and punctuation.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Library Projects&lt;/td>
&lt;td>This is something for the devs. Now, you can create library projects so that you can make a library and share it across your different apps. e.g. you can use same library of code for your paid and free versions, etc.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>wi-fi n&lt;/td>
&lt;td>yes, it supports 802.11n now :)&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>End call with power button&lt;/td>
&lt;td>You can enable this in accessibility settings&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>vcard support&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Nexus one can now handle vcards that someone sends through sms or bluetooth for contact information&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Now, on our list are things/apps that don&amp;rsquo;t work or issues that plague the new update. We will also be listing the workarounds/fixes if known for them.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Issues&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Fix/Workaround/Remarks&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Seesmic app keeps giving &amp;ldquo;Connection error&amp;rdquo; with froyo&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Simple fix is to delete your existing account in seesmic. Setup a new account and uncheck &amp;ldquo;Secure connection&amp;rdquo; in advanced setup.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Swype doesn&amp;rsquo;t work&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Just uninstall swype and swype installer and download/install them again and it will work.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Pure Calendar doesn&amp;rsquo;t work&lt;/td>
&lt;td>New versions have been released to make them work&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Android market doesn&amp;rsquo;t show a lot of apps&lt;/td>
&lt;td>As of now, android market is not showing a lot of paid/copy-protected apps on the market for froyo users. There is a workaround for root users available here: &lt;a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=687371">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=687371&lt;/a>&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Worse radio/3G performance&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Several users at modaco/xda-devs report worse performance with 3G. They say downgrading back to previous radio fixes this but try it at your own risk.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Things missing since previous versions (i.e. Eclair):&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Things missing&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>No “.com” button on the default Android keyboard&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The final part of this post is for things that were rumored to be in the Froyo update for nexus one but aren&amp;rsquo;t present:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Rumored Feature/fix (Not present in Nexus One Froyo Update)&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>FM Radio Receiver&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>FM Transmitter&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s it for now. This is a huge post and I must have missed out on a lot of things for sure. So, if you remember something that I have missed or something has changed over past few days after I wrote/updated this post, please do let me know in comments.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Android Froyo Update File</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/05/22/android-froyo-update/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 May 2010 19:36:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/05/22/android-froyo-update/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just a quick post to tell you how to update your Nexus One to Android 2.2 Froyo immediately without waiting for google to send it to you OTA.&lt;/p>

JDownloader doesn&amp;rsquo;t have an installer but a zip file that you just download and extract somewhere on your PC and start using it. Somehow, the Flashgot extension of Firefox is not able to detect it automatically and I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what parameters to use to add it manually to its list. Latest versions of JDownloader ask you whether you want to install Flashgot or not. I didn&amp;rsquo;t install it because I already had Flashgot. Turns out that this is the missing step. You should allow JDownloader to install Flashgot in your browser, even if it is already installed(If you have already run JDownloader once and didn&amp;rsquo;t say yes to installing flashgot, then you can do it by going to Settings-&amp;gt;Plugins 7 Addons-&amp;gt;Extensions-&amp;gt;Flashgot for Firefox in JDownloader and clicking Install). And then, you will see that the JDownloader option is not grayed out anymore. If you see the version of Flashgot that JDownloader is installs is older than the official version, don&amp;rsquo;t fret. Now, you can re-update the flashgot addon (Tools-&amp;gt;Addons-&amp;gt;Find Updates in firefox) and the JDownloader integration will still stay intact. Hope that helps someone :)&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>This is just a short post to to document how I got JDownloader to integrate with Flashgot.

I took a beam cable connection a few days ago. The price is excellent and speeds are good but the only thing that bothered me was the web based login. You need to open up a browser and login through their online portal before you can access the internet. Now, if you don’t log off, then the login may persist even across PC/router reboots but many times it doesn’t.

Hence, I set out to find a way to do this automatically. (BTW, I’ll also be listing out how I came onto the solution in case you are in interested. If you are not, feel free to skip some paragraphs below to move to the solution)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First off, I came to know that Beam cable supports PPPoE logins, but for the life of me, I (and any of my friends) couldn’t get it working. So, I thought of an alternative approach. Since, this was just a login through a web page, there was a good chance that I could automate it through perl/wget/curl etc. I immediately opened up their portal and took a look at the source code in the hopes of finding out the login form, which I could use to find the POST data that they want and submit it through wget. But what I found was that they are using javascript to do the login process, so no direct way of finding this out. And on top of that, the functions are not embedded in the page but loaded through an external script.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hmm, a setback but a minor one. Javascript is still a client-side executed environment so all hope wasn’t lost. I could have waded through the browser cache to find the js files loaded by the portal and went through the functions to reconstruct the data that I need but I chose an easier way. There is this excellent addon for firefox called “Live Headers”. It shows you all the transactions happening between your browser and the server. So, I just fired it up, filled in my login details in the portal and hit “Login”. On seeing the live headers log, I found out the exact url as well as the POST data that they were sending to do the actual login and from there it was a piece of cake. With “wget”, it is as simple as executing&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>wget &amp;lt;url&amp;gt; --post-data=&amp;lt;data&amp;gt;&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, by substituting the information that I got, this is the command that you need to execute on your PC (For linux/mac it is already installed generally and for windows, you will need to download from &lt;a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm">here&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>wget http://123.176.37.2/newportal/Ajax.php --post-data=&amp;#34;function=ExecuteLogin&amp;amp;user=YOURBEAMUSERNAME&amp;amp;pwd=YOURBEAMPASSWORD&amp;amp;remember=false&amp;amp;timestamp=1271186686298&amp;#34;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Please remember to replace YOURBEAMUSERNAME and YOURBEAMPASSWORD with your actual username and password respectively. Also, please note that the above command is all one single line (it might appear in multiple lines in your browser).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, everytime you need to login just run this command. Now, how to do this automatically? For linux, just put it inside a shell script for linux and set it to run automatically on bootup. For windows, paste the command in a text file, and save it as beam_login.bat and put it in your start up folder so that it runs everytime on boot. (You might want to put some delays in there as it might take some time to get connected to the network or you can query the network interface to run it when the network is up. Let me know if you want to know how to do this for your platform and I can help you).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, this is for the PC, now how about if I need to use non-browser capable devices. This is easy if you have a router with a custom linux firmware (because they generally have wget installed or allow you to install it). I have an Asus wl-500w with oleg’s custom firmware installed and it was a piece of cake with it. I just created the following shell script&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">#!/bin/sh

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">then&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>rm Ajax.php
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">fi&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">#Limit the number of retries to prevent the router from going into continuous loop &lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>num_retries&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">10&lt;/span>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">do&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>wget http://123.176.37.2/newportal/Ajax.php --post-data&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;function=ExecuteLogin&amp;amp;user=YOURBEAMUSERNAME&amp;amp;pwd=YOURBEAMPASSWORD&amp;amp;remember=false&amp;amp;timestamp=1271186686298&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">if&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">[&lt;/span> -e Ajax.php &lt;span style="color:#f92672">]&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">then&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>rm Ajax.php
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>break
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">else&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sleep 2s
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>num_retries&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">`&lt;/span>expr $num_retries - 1&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">`&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">fi&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">done&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Then I set it to run on boot and voila!! A tip for other users of any of the asus routers with oleg’s firmware (like wl-500g, wl-520gu, wl-500gp etc). The firmware has some scripts in the /local/sbin folder that are run at various times. I suggest you put the above code inside the &lt;strong>post-firewall&lt;/strong> script. (Do not forget to run “flashfs save &amp;amp;&amp;amp; flasfs commit &amp;amp;&amp;amp; flashfs enable” to save your changes).

The motivation was that I needed to test a piece of code for a touchscreen driver that I had written at work. The issue was that the UI wasn’t quite ready yet, so I wanted to test just the driver to be working fine. Now, the very first thought for the software to use that came to me was “gnuplot” but I found that it can’t really do this in an easy way. A colleague suggested me to use “replot” command with gnuplot. I whipped out my perl hat and a few hours later, voila!! my very own real time data plotter was ready. Now, I can stream data from any program to this script or provide the data on STDIN and can see the data being plotted continuously. BTW, it was awesome to see all the shapes that I drew on my target board’s LCD touchscreen to come alive on my PC monitor almost instantaneously.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>I wrote this script a few days ago to plot real-time / streaming data with gnuplot.

&lt;p>You are free to download, install, modify and use this script for any commercial/non-commercial purposes. However, if you modify the script and/or re-distribute it, I’d like to request you to keep the attribution to me as the author intact in the script as well as provide a credit/linkback to this page in associated files/webpages etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>I’d also be happy if you can send me your modifications to fix any bugs or add new features and would be glad to incorporate them and host them here if you want.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can also send in any bug reports or feature requests by posting a comment below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Requirements:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://www.perl.org/get.html">Perl&lt;/a> (Tested on v5.6.1 and v5.10. If you have linux, this might already be installed. For Windows, please click on the link.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/download.html">gnuplot&lt;/a> (Tested with v 4.2.6)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Installation:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Install the above mentioned requirements&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make sure that you can run “perl” and “gnuplot” commands (“pgnuplot” instead of “gnuplot” if you have windows) in your shell/command prompt. If you see an issue, add the path to the executables for these to your environment variables.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Download the below linked zip file and unzip it to any location (preferably to a place where you have write permissions as a normal user).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Usage:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The script is named rtgnuplotter.pl. The various details regarding its usage are as below:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Input Parameters:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>-xrange min:max (Optional) Horizantal Range
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>-yrange min:max (Optional) Vertical Range
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>-invertx (Optional) Invert horizontal Axis
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>-inverty (Optional) Invert Vertical Axis
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>-hex (Optional) Input data is in hex (without leading 0x)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>-joindots (Optional) Data points are connected with lines
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>-h\-help\-v (Optional) Print usage and version info
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Input Data: The input data for rtgnuplotter is expected to be two space separated numbers, the first number being for x axis and second for y axis. Each set of coordinates denoting a point to be plotted should be on a new line. Hexadecimal as well as decimal numbers are supported. For Hexadecimal input, use the “-hex” option but the numbers should not have “0x” prefix.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Usage: All the options for rtgnuplotter are optional. You can run it with/without any options and it will wait for you to provide input on standard input. You can also pipe data into the script from another program using “|”. Few examples of the usage are:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>perl rtgnuplotter.pl
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>tail -f mydata.log | grep --line-buffered “Data Points” | sed --unbuffered ‘s/.*x=\([0-9.-]*\).*y=\([0-9.-]*\).*/\1 \2/’ | perl rtgnuplotter.pl
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>In the second example above, we get the data being written to a logfile by some other program, grep for the lines that have our points, then extract just the numbers with sed and then pass them to rtgnuplotter. Please note that “&amp;ndash;line-buffered” and “&amp;ndash;unbuffered” options used with grep and sed respectively, are important, otherwise you might not see your data being plotted immediately.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The zip file also contains a test file “inp.pl” that you can use to test the script. inp.pl generates some random numbers To run the test, just cd to the place where you unzipped the file and run the command line given in 2nd example in one command window and “perl inp.pl &amp;gt; temp.txt” in another.&lt;/p>

I was working on a script yesterday, a part of which depended on continuous monitoring of a text file. I had used our trusty old &amp;ldquo;tail&amp;rdquo; command for this but while testing by manually putting in some data into the file, it was failing but curiously it was working fine when used in actual scenario. Befuddled, I did a simple test. I created a simple text file &amp;ldquo;a.txt&amp;rdquo; with a few lines of data and then ran the following command.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>tail -f a.txt&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It showed the last few lines of the file and kept waiting. So far so good. Then I opened the file in vim editor, wrote a few more lines, saved the file and then waited but nothing in the window that was running the tail command. Thinking that the data might be buffered and not flushed to the disc yet, I ran the sync command but still nothing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I got a hint that when I used the &amp;ldquo;-F&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;&amp;ndash;follow=name&amp;rdquo; option instead of &amp;ldquo;-f&amp;rdquo;, the tail command was able to detect the change just fine, the only problem being that in this mode, it prints the last few lines again, not just the newly added line. The main difference in these new options is that tail command tracks the file for changes by its name and not by the file descriptor, and then it dawned on me. The problem is not in the tail command but my testing method itself. When I save the file opened in vim, it creates a new file with a new inode while the one opened by tail is still the old one (which is now a temporary file which has actually been deleted). When I quit tail, then the kernel deletes the file automatically. This is also confirmed by running &amp;ldquo;lsof | grep a.txt&amp;rdquo; (lsof lists the open files and then we find the ones related to a.txt). The output shown is;&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>tail 11966 shantanu 3r REG 8,6 8 224954 /home/shantanu/dev/perl/plot/a.txt~ (deleted)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>vim 12576 shantanu 9u REG 8,6 12288 210918 /home/shantanu/dev/perl/plot/.a.txt.swp
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>which shows what we had discussed above. This gets worked around when I use the -F option because then tail periodically reopens the file by name and reads it again, thus bypassing the above issue. Then I simply tried running tail again on the same file and doing something like &amp;ldquo;echo abc &amp;raquo; a.txt&amp;rdquo; and I could see the behaviour as expected with tail immediately detecting the change and displaying it in its window. Hope this helps if you have been pulling out your hair thinking you have gone crazy as your favourite little tool that you have been using for so many years has suddenly stopped working and no one else apart from you is even complaining :P&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Paradise For Overclockers, Gamers and PC Enthusiasts In India</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/12/07/overclockers-pc-enthusiasts-gamers-india/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2009 18:05:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/12/07/overclockers-pc-enthusiasts-gamers-india/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is just to let you know that a few of my friends have started &lt;a href="http://www.overclocked.in">Overclocked&lt;/a>, a haven for PC enthusiasts in India.

Here are the 2 main issues that I faced along with their solutions, in the hope that if someone else runs into same issues does not have to waste time (and hair) on it :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>1. Bootloader Issue:&lt;/strong> I dual boot my system along with Win XP (Needed for some office work) and generally install the bootloader onto a separate boot partition instead of overwriting the MBR. But this time when I did the same, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t boot (not even the grub menu). When I did this, the very helpful message that I got on restarting after installing kubuntu was “Error loading operating system”. I could still go back to my good windows install by setting the boot flag onto its partition. I mucked around with it a lot, trying to install grub2 again and found that actually it fails when I try to do the above (install on a partition). I also tried copying the boot sector from my /boot partition to C: and use ntldr to boot into linux but that also didn’t work. This lead me to believe that the same thing happened during my main installation and the installer failed to tell me anything about it. I tried then to install it on MBR but that also mucked up things and I couldn’t even get the error message, a cursor just kept blinking. Finally, the solution. I had to install kubuntu again and this time selected to overwrite MBR (this is default, BTW).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2. Wi-Fi Connection Issue:&lt;/strong> Second immediate issue was with knetworkmanager. It failed to start my wi-fi module (even after installing restricted drivers). I disabled and enabled wi-fi, so that brought some life to it (wi-fi led started glowing) but it still couldn’t scan for any access points. I could do the scan through command line and see my AP but my AP is WPA2 secured and I didn’t want to mess around with wpa-supplicant stuff. Solution: Installed Wicd. And it worked automagically.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hope this helps someone else who faces the same issue. Looks like my idea of moving to kubuntu wasn’t a good one (especially because I had 2 lockups during the 1 hour I used it for in the wee hours of this morning). I’ll probably give it another week or so before taking the decision whether to move back to ubuntu or not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One good thing to take away from this though: For the first time I could really appreciate the live CD installer that these linux distros give. As I could search about the various issues I had without having a second computer. But then again, it’s not that good as well because it means that so far I never had any installation issues at all…&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Making Frets On Fire Work With Pulse Aludio - pasuspender</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/08/23/make-frets-on-fire-work-pulse-audio-pasuspender/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Aug 2009 18:18:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/08/23/make-frets-on-fire-work-pulse-audio-pasuspender/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently got hold of a Guitar Hero controller for my PS3 but the game still had some time to come so I tried it out on my laptop with Frets on Fire (rather FoFix).

And yeah, do not hesitate to point out the flaws if any and I&amp;rsquo;d also love to hear about the tactics that you follow as well as KZ2 is a game where the element of surprise is very important which calls for unusual strategies many times ;).&lt;br>
So without wasting any more time, here is a really really basic set that you should follow:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Engineer&amp;rsquo;s Prime Role:&lt;/strong> Understand that your role is not that of a front line assault. An engineer is best suited as a defender or a support class.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Engineer&amp;rsquo;s Weapon - Shotgun&lt;/strong>: The shotgun is called the one shot killer. It fires a burst of various pellets resulting in a much larger hit area and so you need not be extremely accurate. But it has some salient points to be noted while using it.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Shotgun is useful only in a very short range. Avoid long range combat because 99% you will find yourself dead without even getting a single hit point at the opponent. This means lurk around in corners or alleyways, take the less travelled routes to your destinations, and let your turrets do the most of your job for you&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Shotgun is slightly heavy as compared to other weapons and hence you will find yourself moving that right analog stick quite a bit more for aiming.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Shotgun has a high reload time between bullets and especially the full magazine. So if you are in middle of a fight and run out of a mag, it&amp;rsquo;s best to take out your M4 revolver instead of waiting to reload (or just run away if you are not confident enough of your revolver or haven&amp;rsquo;t unlocked it yet)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Engineer&amp;rsquo;s Primary Ability - Turrets&lt;/strong>:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Find elevated places. It has two advantages. First, it is more difficult for the opposition to take it out because it is above the eye level and second, your turret has more chances of getting headshots leading to faster kills and more points.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cover up alleyways/alternate routes which the enemy can take to flank your team. This is more important than you think. You are, in effect, forcing the opposition to take a route where most of your team mates can easily take them down.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t place them close to walls as it makes them more susceptible to damage.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t bunch up your turrets, keep them a safe distance apart. This has two advantages. First, it is more difficult for the enemy to take out your turrets (otherwise they can take them out together easily), plus each turret can give cover to the other and also attack the enemy from two sides taking him down quickly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For rounds like Search &amp;amp; Destroy/ Defend or assassination, don&amp;rsquo;t place turrets very close to the objective point but at a slight distance, at a place where the turret has clear line of sight to the objective point and/or the path to it. This will make it safe from the enemy while raining hell onto him while he is concentrating somewhere else.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Engineer&amp;rsquo;s Secondary Ability - Repair&lt;/strong>:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Repair ability is a very underrated ability. It might not give you a hell lot of points by itself but it is very important for your team.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Repairing ammo crates is a natural thing as your team mates might need it but that is not the most important thing to concentrate upon as people might not need them too often as people die often in KZ2 and moreover they might not want to waste time taking stuff out of the crate and risking their life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>First important use of repair ability is to repair your own turrets. Your turrets go under wear and tear as time progresses or when attacked by someone. It is of utmost importance to keep repairing them because you have to wait for a lot of time before you can set up another turret while repair ability recharges much faster.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Second is to repair the emplaced/mounted machine guns at various places in the maps. Repair them and use them to take down the enemy quickly (especially useful for S&amp;amp;D). But make sure that another guy/turret is protecting you from out of peripheral-view attacks.
So that&amp;rsquo;s it for now. But keep in mind that just reading these tips won&amp;rsquo;t help unless you &lt;strong>practice.&lt;/strong> Let me know if you found these tips helpful or if you have any map/situation specific queries and if you would like to add your own strategies. I&amp;rsquo;ll take up a new class next time.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

With the 1.9.2.7-g version of his firmware, oleg added a new feature with which if you press the **EZ Setup **button at the back of the router for 3 seconds, it executes a script &amp;ldquo;/usr/local/sbin/ez-setup&amp;rdquo;, if present.

What I noticed was that my CPU usage went through the roof (constantly at 100%) even if the guest was completely idle. Result: My laptop was shutting down within a few minutes because the CPU was heating up and its temperature going beyond 75C. And finally came to know a simple solution from a friend, that immediately worked. The solution was to create a new dummy guest machine in VirtualBox, allocate minimal RAM to it (I gave 4MB) and just run it, don’t even need to add boot disk to it and to my surprise, the CPU usage came down to just 3-4% immediately. I’m not sure why this issue is happening and how the dummy machine solved it but atleast it is working for me now.

The last stable build released (2.4.2) was good but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of features provided by the nightly builds in svn (subversion). And the last nightly build released (svn-1696) had a lot of broken things. It was rebuilding the database everytime, crashed around quite a bit, had a lot of security holes.

So, I decided to get the latest version (trunk) of the FireFly code, as it had a lot of fixes for above issues, put in whatever was missing, and try to build it for my use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a day&amp;rsquo;s worth of efforts, here it is. This latest build is the most rich in features as compared to the stable one, and is just as stable as the 2.4.2 release if not better, and also fixes all the issues shown by the svn-1696 build. The downloadable source and complete install package are attached with this post. But I&amp;rsquo;m also listing down the steps that I took to achieve this so that if anyone wants to recompile it with their own options (e.g. I haven’t included ogg/flac support in my build), they are able to do so. You can find the steps below. Please let me know if you have any queries. Also, if you want to submit any patches, I’ll be happy to incorporate them and recompile. I’m also trying to get this source and package into the unslung/optware repositories for wider distribution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note: Although I’ve compiled this for Asus WL-500W, it should work for most devices with a mipsel architecture (which includes all the Asus routers in this family). Also, the compilation process should work for most other architectures barring one or two steps. I’d be happy to help if you want to do so and face any issues.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Changes and Build Steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>ipkg install optware-devel&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>ipkg install buildroot&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Edit /opt/share/aclocal/audiofile.m4 and change AC_DEFUN(AM_PATH_AUDIOFILE, to AC_DEFUN([AM_PATH_AUDIOFILE],&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>ipkg install gettext (for some missing m4 macros, libr_rpath etc)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Comment out AC_USE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS in configure.in (using dnl)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>aclocal -I &amp;lt;path of mt-daapd&amp;rsquo;s local m4 dir&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>run “autoheader” to generate config.h.in&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>touch config.rpath (somehow this file is not provided with gettext for us)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>change configure.in line 95, remove the ; at the end&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>remove -g flag and add -O2 in configure.in for optimization purpose&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>run “automake &amp;ndash;add-missing”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>run “autoconf” - to generate configure&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>ipkg install grep (for egrep)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>change /bin/sh to /opt/bin/bash in configure and install-sh&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>run “./configure &amp;ndash;enable-sqlite3 &amp;ndash;prefix=/opt CPFLAGS=”-D_LIBC” ” (You can also use &amp;ndash;enable-oggvorbis and/or &amp;ndash;enableflac)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>After this step, I had to make numerous changes to the source code to put in the missing functionality for database handling, removing some compilation errors, etc. You can diff the svn 1715 code with mine to see the changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>run “make”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>run “make install”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>And you are done. The modified source and compiled bianries can be downloaded from below.&lt;/p>

As soon as there was an outage, it couldn’t stop the PS3 from an abrupt shut down. I ran around the pathetic Microtek customer service for days and they finally sent an “engineer” down to my place (after a week) to diagnose the issue and he couldn’t say anything more than that the UPS is meant for a PC and nothing else. All logical discussions to tell him that PS3 is essentially a PC but in a different form were kind of like pouring water on a well-oiled rock and hoping it would stick.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>I got myself a &lt;strong>Microtek 800VA UPS (MDP800+)&lt;/strong> a couple of weeks ago to save my PS3 from the frequent power outages that we are seeing in Hyderabad but the purpose was rather lost when I found that it worked fine only till the mains power was on.

All logical discussions to tell him that PS3 is essentially a PC but in a different form were kind of like pouring water on a well-oiled rock and hoping it would stick.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kind of disappointed, I had a hunch which solved it for me though today :). When I tried to read the output voltage from the output ports on the UPS, it showed me 225–230V when main supply was on. As soon as it was switched off, the output dropped to around 160V. On connecting the PS3, it went up a bit (to around 180V). Now, the load should not have been an issue because a PS3 requires 180–350W I think, which can easily be given by even a 500VA UPS. So far, all suggestions given to me were to remove everything else from the UPS except the PS3, but that was actually my setup in the very first place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The weird idea that I had was that the problem is, in fact, that the PS3 is not enough load for it. Call me crazy but as soon as I connected my TV also to the UPS, it started working just fine and dandy. No trip ups now, and I can even cold-boot my PS3 and TV from the UPS backup alone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, I ain’t the sharpest tool in the shed when it comes to electrical stuff (in fact this was one of my most dreaded subjects during my graduation). So, if anyone can give me a sound reasoning behind what I just saw would be very much appreciated. Or is this a real fault with the unit that I got, or maybe it is a defect in all the Microtek UPS’s? Anyways, I ain’t complaining till it’s working for me :) and if you are seeing the same issues you could try the same as well.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Why You Should Not Upgrade to Ubuntu Jaunty Jackalope (9.04)</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/05/04/ubuntu-904-jaunty-jackalope-upgrade-graphics-problem/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 May 2009 17:46:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/05/04/ubuntu-904-jaunty-jackalope-upgrade-graphics-problem/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update: It has come to my notice that many people do not know about this (and other problems listed in comments of this post).

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You have an older ATI graphics card (prior to R500, .e.g xpress 200m)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You like to have 3D support (read compiz/games, etc)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This is because of the following reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Ubuntu Jaunty Jackalope has the new version of X.org server (1.6)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The open source graphics drivers for ATI do not have 3D support&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The only version of the ATI properietary drivers (fglrx\Catalyst) compatible with X.org server 1.6 is 9.4&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Support for older cards (mentioned above) was dropped from fglrx 9.4&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So, basically right now you are in a soup and it seems to me that this is going to remain this way unless someone figures out how to backport x.org 1.5 onto Jauntu, which is going to be a hell of a task, IMHO :P&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, if you are a simple person, who looks beyond the gloss of the 3D and marvels at the beauty that the rest of the system holds, then go right ahead and dive in :)&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>TIP: Perforce - Sync Files In A Label Without Deleting Previous Files</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/03/27/p4perforce-sync-files-label-without-deleting-previous/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Mar 2009 14:00:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/03/27/p4perforce-sync-files-label-without-deleting-previous/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you have used perforce, you&amp;rsquo;d have definitely come across a situation where you wanted to sync files belonging to two different labels, but as soon as you sync the second label, the files from the first label get deleted.

One way could have been to post the comments on the original site of the article but that had the drawbacks that:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Others might not even go to the original site to check these comments&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>We might not want to make this discussion public outside of our social group&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The original site might not even allow comments&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Another way was to keep sharing the item again and again with your own notes, but that would really become a pain (as you can imagine where).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, google listened to my unspoken thoughts and from this morning onwards, we have a new commenting feature on shared items. Click on the pic below to see it. So, they have given an alternate commenting system that you can use in your friend circle to discuss any item. Really cool, I&amp;rsquo;d say. What do you think?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(PS: The people who were &amp;ldquo;predicting&amp;rdquo; a couple of months ago that Google is going to &lt;strong>shut down&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>Google Reader&lt;/strong>, well, I don&amp;rsquo;t think so. I think they are workign full steam on it to make it an essential part in their grand scheme of things to create an ecosystem, along with &lt;strong>Google Friend Connect&lt;/strong>)&lt;/p>

My ISP is Airtel and the modem that I have is Beetel 110-BXi (They also have other models like 220-BX and 220 BXi). One thing common among all these modems is that they do not provide secure access like Secure Shell (ssh) as all they provide is ftp/telnet/http etc which are all clear text protocols. Hence, it is a huge security risk to expose these interfaces to the internet and then access them from outside. So, I (and most others) don&amp;rsquo;t allow these services to be accessed from WAN. But I do have the need some time to access it. So, what do I do? I follow a simple process to allow myself a pseudo-ssh or telnet picggy-backed over ssh connection.

&lt;p>Well, I have an excellent wi-fi router (Asus WL-500W) that does have ssh (which I have configured to listen on, say, port XXXX). Now all I do is:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Disable telnet access to modem from WAN but enable from LAN.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Forward this particular port XXXX in modem&amp;rsquo;s configuration to the router&amp;rsquo;s IP.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Optional: Register for a dynamic dns account (e.g. dyndns.org) and update the same in modem&amp;rsquo;s config so I can access my modem through a domain name since I have a dynamic IP which changes all the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Now, ssh to my external (WAN) IP from outside (say from work). Since, the port is forwarded to my router, it the router that answers my ssh request.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>After logging in to my router, simply telnet to the modem using its LAN IP and configure away.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Simple, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? I would advise you all to make a similar setup for yourself as well, if possible, rather than taking risks of unsecure access.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>[TIP] Install Twonky on Asus WL-500W with stock firmware</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/02/23/tip-install-twonky-on-asus-wl-500w-with-stock-firmware/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2009 06:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/02/23/tip-install-twonky-on-asus-wl-500w-with-stock-firmware/</guid><description>&lt;p>Asus WL-500W is a greate wi-fi router with lots of features, one of them being able to use it as a media server to serve movies/songs over your network from a hard disk connected directly to it through USB.

If you do not want to take any risks with the custom firmwares, I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you a simple way to use twonky with the stock firmware itself. Follow these steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Download Twonky (The MIPS version) and extract/save it to some place on the harddisk attached to your router (e.g. /tmp/harddisk/part0/twonky/ )&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Create a new shell script for starting twonky automatically (Replace the paths according to where you stored the twonky files in step 1). All you need to do is create a text file with following contents and mark it as executable. We&amp;rsquo;ll name it init.sh.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">#!/bin/sh

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>cd /tmp/harddisk/part0/twonky&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/br&amp;gt;/tmp/harddisk/part0/twonky/twonkymedia &amp;amp;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Copy this script to your harddisk to where you extracted twonky files.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Open up the router&amp;rsquo;s web administration page (most probably at 192.168.1.1), go to the USB section, and put the following line under &amp;ldquo;Initial Script&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>`/tmp/harddisk/part0/twonky/init.sh``&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="5">
&lt;li>Save, reboot and enjoy :)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>If you have any questions, let me know. Infact, the same tip can be used to install many other such softwares onto your Asus routers series including WL-500g, WL-500gP, WL-500W, etc.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>KillZone 2 Steel-Book Edition is here</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/02/20/killzone-2-steel-book-edition-is-here/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2009 21:47:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/02/20/killzone-2-steel-book-edition-is-here/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note: Please &lt;a href="http://digg.com/playstation/KillZone_2_Steel_Book_Edition_is_here">DIGG this post by clicking here&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/7z1u7/killzone_2_steelbook_edition_is_here/">Reddit this post by clicking here&lt;/a>.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, this is a super-light and easy to use plugin that allows you to add any text or html/javascript/php code to your posts, be it the top of the posts, bottom of the posts or even in the middle. And you get a lot of options to control all this. I use it even on my site, to create links for my other blogs, adding copyright notices and even for advertisements (google adsense, chitika premium, etc).&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>My WordPress Plugin &amp;ldquo;Shantz Wordpress Prefix Suffix&amp;rdquo; has just been updated to version 1.1.2.

&lt;p>This update brings in WordPress 2.7.1 compatibility and also another option to control the plugin order. If there are some other plugins that add content to your posts (e.g. sociable, simple tags, related posts, etc), you might notice that the text/code you append with this plugin may not occur in exactly the place you want (e.g. you might want to occur after all other plugins have posted their content). So, you can easily control this now by changing the priority value in the plugin settings. Make it higher to push the content down and lower it to add your content before anything else.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Project: Shantz XWinWrap Update to 0.3</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/02/16/project-shantz-xwinwrap-update-to-03/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2009 18:30:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/02/16/project-shantz-xwinwrap-update-to-03/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here is another update for the fans of XWinWrap, the tiny program that allows you to run animated wallpapers on your system. You could use screensavers, movies and what not as your desktop background. This update fixes a segfault that many users were facing, a new debug option to print some debug mesages to get some info if it is not working for you and a new hack option for giving a &amp;ldquo;desktop window&amp;rdquo; name to the program. On many systems, the desktop is drawn by another program. e.g. in Ubuntu with Gnome environment, the desktop is managed by Nautilus, which creates a special window called &amp;ldquo;Desktop&amp;rdquo; and places it over your real desktop. This window name can be different in different systems. To find out what is yours, just run &amp;ldquo;xwininfo&amp;rdquo; in a terminal. Your cursor will become a &amp;ldquo;+&amp;rdquo; sign. Click anywhere on an empty area on your desktop, which will give you the window name of the transparent window, if any, that is covering your desktop. Pass this info to xwinwrap using the option &amp;ldquo;-d windowname&amp;rdquo; and it would help it to run better.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>Here is another update for the fans of XWinWrap, the tiny program that allows you to run animated wallpapers on your system.

Many of the applications, that he regularly used, were misbehaving. e.g., he couldn&amp;rsquo;t play flash videos in firefox, downloads were failing, installation of new applications were failing, etc. Everything was giving errors of not enough disk space even though he had quite a few GBs left on his drive. A few of the error messages pointed out that there wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough space in /tmp. And indeed, he was unable to store anything more than 1 MB inside this particular directory. After a quick look I found out the issue. Ubuntu had created another partition with /tmp being its mount point and its maz size was set to 1 MB.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>Recently someone asked me about an issue he was facing with his Ubuntu Hardy Heron installation.

After a quick look I found out the issue. Ubuntu had created another partition with /tmp being its mount point and its maz size was set to 1 MB.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A search told me that this occurs if you happen to run out of disk space on your root partition some time, so Ubuntu automatically limits the size of /tmp to squeeze as much out of the remaining space as it can. Ideally, original behaviour of /tmp should be restored once you recover some space but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen. The solution? Well, it is pretty simple. Just follow these steps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step 1. Open up /etc/mtab in your favourite editor. e.g. gksudo gedit /etc/mtab&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step 2. Look for a line that looks something like below example and delete it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>overflow /tmp tmpfs rw,size=1048576,mode=1777 0 0&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step 3. Save the file and restart your computer. That&amp;rsquo;s it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, this problem might not just be Ubuntu specific though and might happen with other distros as well. So, if you come across such an issue, try out this solution.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>[Ubuntu TIP] Solved: Totem Cannot Detect UPnP Media Server</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/01/31/ubuntu-tip-solved-totem-cannot-detect-upnp-media-server/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2009 17:46:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/01/31/ubuntu-tip-solved-totem-cannot-detect-upnp-media-server/</guid><description>&lt;p>First a bit of background. A UPnP media server can serve your media files (video / audio / pictures) over the network to any compatible player. Some of the most known examples of these media servers are MediaTomb, TVersity, ushare, etc. In linux, few players can play media off these servers natively, but many require a plugin / library called &amp;ldquo;coherence&amp;rdquo;. e.g. the default media players (Totem and RhythmBox) can detect and play media from media servers once you install coherence (&amp;ldquo;sudo apt-get install python-coherence&amp;rdquo;). This works, BUT you will see that many times Totem will stop detecting the server suddenly. It happens to me quite a bit (The server I use is Mediatomb). First I thought that the problem is with Media Tomb, but my PS3 continued to play videos from it over wi-fi without any issues, so that was ruled out. I tried many things but in the end, the solution turned out to be pretty simple. The problem seems to be that the coherence library hangs some times. Simple thing is to just restart it. So, all you need to do is run the following command:&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>First a bit of background.

&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>My company had a video contest a few days ago (which yours-truly won by a handsome margin :) ). The topic was “Future of Wireless” as perceived by the employees but with the catch that it had to be done in just 10 seconds or less.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, everyone know that there is rarely a moment when I can think like a normal, sane person, and hence took a rather “alternative” look at what the future holds for us. (Hint: “Mine is bigger” jokes are gonna be in fashion again ;) ). Take a look below and don’t forget to leave your comments on how you liked it.

&lt;p>Some benefits for users:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>A comprehensive listing of great solutions for individual as well business needs based on google products.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>All products go through an approval process by Google to ensure a certain standard of quality and basic checks to prevent frauds&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>A user based review system to put the good and the bad ones apart&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Very basic to advanced apps available for free as well as paid ones.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Paid ones may also have option to use google checkout for payment&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some benefits for developers:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>No need to create and maintain a website for their products&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Good exposure to a wide audience without spending a dime. yes, all listings are free, even for paid apps.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Payments can be taken through Google Checkout or your own payment gateway&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Certainly a good initiative by Google. Some of the good apps I found are (all free ones, since I’m a cheapskate :D ): &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/enterprise/marketplace/viewListing?productListingId=5143210+6352879591152674960">Google Short Links&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/enterprise/marketplace/viewListing?productListingId=4147159+11927776548951023888">Gmail Backup&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/enterprise/marketplace/viewListing?productListingId=3538797+14883126272580344305">Google Email Uploader&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/enterprise/marketplace/viewListing?productListingId=4915422+2675796265305842710">LuckyCal&lt;/a>, etc.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Now, I just caught another conflict between google and adsense on my own blog. Basically, Google is against TLAs (text-link-ads) since they mess up the search engine rankings and even penalizes any site that sells or buys them. But look what I found in one of the ads displayed in google.&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>This would definitely make life that much more better as the open source developers fix these particular drivers (ALSA people, start your engines)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This also means another big inroads into the commercial world for open source as creative is definitely one of the big boys around.&lt;/p>

But definitely not, if you follow this advise.

&lt;p>Note: This is perfectly fine according to Google Adsense TOS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What we&amp;rsquo;ll do is implement a search box (Adsense For Search) on the 404 error page, which will net us the following benefits:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Give the users a way to search for what they would have come looking for and hence retain them on your website.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make money if they click on any ads that are shown by Adsense for search.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now we&amp;rsquo;ll see how to do it for a wordpress blog as well as a static site.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-to-implement-google-adsense-for-search-for-your-blog">How to implement google adsense for search for your blog:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Common step:&lt;/strong> The first step for independent of what kind of site you have, is to sign up for &lt;a href="http://google.com/adsense/">Google Adsense Publisher Account&lt;/a>. Once you have signed up, log on to your account and go to Adsense Setup -&amp;gt; Get Ads -&amp;gt; Adsense For Search. Customize the box according to your need. (Select the &amp;ldquo;Open search results in my website&amp;rdquo; option to make sure users remain on your site. And insert a url where you&amp;rsquo;d like to show the results. e.g. mine is &lt;a href="http://tech.shantanugoel.com/search/">http://tech.shantanugoel.com/search/&lt;/a> ). Once you are done, you will get two snippets of code. One for displaying the search box and another for displaying the search results. Lets call them &amp;ldquo;Adsense-For-Search-Box-Code&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Adsense-For-Search-Results-Code&amp;rdquo;. We&amp;rsquo;ll use them below for our implmentation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>For a static site:&lt;/strong> A static site is one where you have static/hand-coded html pages (i.e., not generated by a server side language, e.g. PHP). This requires 3 steps now:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step 1) Create a 404.html page that will contain your search box code and will be displayed in case of a 404 error. A simple sample implmentation would be a blank page that contains just the search box code. The contents of this page can be as shown below:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&amp;#34;your website header&amp;#34;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&amp;#34;Adsense-For-Search-Box-Code&amp;#34;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&amp;#34;your website footer&amp;#34;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>However, you might want to blend this in with your other website pages by including the look of header, sidebars, footers, etc, and in place of content just paste in the code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step 2) Create a search-results.html page that will contain the search results (You need to enter &lt;code>http://&amp;gt;your-domain-name&amp;lt;/search-result.html&lt;/code> in the adsense settings for this). Here, also you can either create a blank html page with just the search results code added or mimic the look of your website. Possible Contents:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&amp;#34;your website header&amp;#34;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&amp;#34;Adsense-For-Search-Results-Code&amp;#34;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&amp;#34;your website footer&amp;#34;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Step 3) Modify your .htaccess file to add the following line:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-apache" data-lang="apache">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>ErrorDocument &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">404&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">/404.html&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>And you are done. For a wordpress site, read on:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>For a WordPress based site/blog:&lt;/strong> For a wordpress based site, you don’t have to modify the .htaccess. The 3 steps you have to follow are as below:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step 1) Create or modify your 404.php file (generally in your theme’s root directory, e.g. &lt;code>http://&amp;lt;your-site-name&amp;gt;/wp-content/themes/&amp;lt;your-theme&amp;gt;/404.php&lt;/code> ) to include the adsense for search box code. e.g.:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-php" data-lang="php">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;?&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">php&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">get_header&lt;/span>(); &lt;span style="color:#75715e">?&amp;gt;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">&amp;lt;div id=&amp;#34;content&amp;#34;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">&amp;#34;Adsense-For-Search-Box-Code&amp;#34;

Create a new page with its url/slug being &lt;code>http://&amp;lt;your-site-name&amp;gt;/search&lt;/code> (e.g. &lt;a href="http://tech.shantanugoel.com/search">http://tech.shantanugoel.com/search&lt;/a> ) or whatever that you input in your adsense settings. Make sure you select the page template as “Google Adsense Search Results” as we had mentioned in the search-results.php file at the top. Save this page and you are done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, try to go to any non-existent url on your site (You can try this with this blog also, appending any weird url after &lt;a href="http://tech.shantanugoel.com/">http://tech.shantanugoel.com/&lt;/a> ) and you will be presented with the nice adsense-for search box. Let me know if this helped you out or you find any shortcomings in this or have any of your own tips. Also let me know if you need my specific 404.php and search-results.php files.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Save Your Adsense Account: Put Up That Privacy Policy</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/11/04/save-your-adsense-account-put-up-that-privacy-policy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2008 17:35:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/11/04/save-your-adsense-account-put-up-that-privacy-policy/</guid><description>&lt;p>Google is known to be pretty strict with making sure that all Adsense publishers remain conformant to their policies.

&lt;p>Hi,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During a recent review of your account we noticed that you are currently displaying Google ads on [domain name removed] but do not have a privacy policy posted which discloses how the site uses third party advertising companies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As stated in our program policies, sites displaying Google ads should include a privacy policy that informs visitors of the use of cookies and/or web beacons to serve ads. You can find more information about this requirement here: &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/answer.py?answer=100557">http://www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/answer.py?answer=100557&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To ensure that your site is in compliance with this policy, please create a privacy policy page and link to it from any pages which display Google ads. You can find some privacy policy examples and tips here: &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/answer.py?answer=100557">http://www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/answer.py?answer=100557&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you have taken the necessary corrective action, please reply to this email so that we can follow up accordingly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We appreciate your cooperation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sincerely,
The Google AdSense Team&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now why I wrote this post was that though almost every site I visit has adsense ads, but only a very miniscule fraction of them is abiding with this condition. Maybe they don’t know this because on my search, I came to know that this clause was added to google’s policy around March this year. I don’t know how much fuss is google is going to create over this but I’d rather be safe than sorry. Especially when it takes only a few minutes to create your privacy policy. To create yours with a few clicks, I came across a simple online template here: &lt;a href="http://www.serprank.com/privacy-policy-generator/index.php">Adsense Privacy Policy Generator&lt;/a>. I too used it (with a few modifications) to create my own &lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/privacy/">privacy policy&lt;/a>. You are free to use it to create your own.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Microsoft Has A Problem: Software Patents Go Up In Smoke</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/10/31/microsoft-has-a-problem-software-patents-go-up-in-smoke/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2008 18:35:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/10/31/microsoft-has-a-problem-software-patents-go-up-in-smoke/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just read over at groklaw about a ruling made last night by the US Appeals Court. According to it, the patents granted for business practices would have to undergo specific and stringent testing procedures to check the worthiness of granting a patent to it. Essentially, they are aiming to mandate a passing of &amp;ldquo;machine-or-transformation test&amp;rdquo; as a pre-requisite for granting a patent. This means that a mere &amp;ldquo;idea in my head&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t qualify for a patent until it is put into practice on a machine or can transform the state of an object for a specific purpose. Am no lawyer but what the experts are making out from the long judgement is that many industries will be hit hard by this ruling. Especially software companies who own most of the software patents as business practices, and a majority of these would be found unworthy of patents as they would be found too generic and stifling for the growth of industry.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>Just read over at groklaw about a ruling made last night by the US Appeals Court.

&lt;p>So, companies like Microsoft would have a lot to rue about as a huge portion of their patent portfolio has become circumspect. This not only would rob them of revenues in terms of royalties but would also open up a lot of space for competition as well. Special thanks to Red Hat to take up the fight and providing crucial data to the court to take this decision. Stallman and FSF would be very happy today :)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I had this experience with my webhost just a couple of days back. My site was being hammered by 100s and 1000s of visitors from stumbleupon, digg, linux.com, linuxtoday, lxer, lifehacker, etc all at the same time. Needless to say I ran out of my 15 GB monthly bandwidth in no time. So many visitors coming but finding a mundane “509 Bandwidth exceeded” error. Alas!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I mailed my host that I was willing to pay a bit more to get some more bandwidth per month so that this doesnt occur in the future. I woke up in the morning and found a one-liner reply in my box that made my day “&lt;strong>Increased monthly limit to 20 GB”. Without any charge.&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>Even though I was willing to pay&lt;/strong> and  had told them so. And already I’m paying a very measly amount for my hosting (20$ per year) so they are not retaining a BIG customer as well. I’m just a tiny fish. If that is not the sign of a good webhost then I don’t know what is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You must be curious who my webhost is (those of you already haven’t whois’ed it). Well, the host is &lt;a href="http://www.rvh.in/billing/aff.php?aff=021">Real Value Hosting&lt;/a>. Do visit them. We need to have more hosters like them.&lt;/p>

Send custom automatic replies to different people when they message you and came across a strange bug. It never sent the reply when you received the first message from someone. I was using the &amp;ldquo;ReceivedImMessage&amp;rdquo; signal over d-bus (or &amp;ldquo;received-im-message&amp;rdquo; for the plugin writers). What I found initially looked to be a gross and basic error by pidgin developers, but later found that it is indeed a good design and thought that I&amp;rsquo;ll make a post about it for the benefit of fellow pidgin plugin/app developers.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>Recently I wrote a small autoreply-answering-machine app for pidgin with a simple premise.

What I found initially looked to be a gross and basic error by pidgin developers, but later found that it is indeed a good design and thought that I&amp;rsquo;ll make a post about it for the benefit of fellow pidgin plugin/app developers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a bit of debugging I saw that when I received the ReceivedImMessage signal for the first message, the &amp;ldquo;Conversation ID&amp;rdquo; field is not a valid value but 0. Thereafter, I got the correct value every time. Searching on the google didn&amp;rsquo;t reveal much except a few other people complaining about the same and someone saying that this is a bug because pidgin first sends the signal and then creates the conversation while it should be the other way round.  Fair enough. But then&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I came across a short explanation by a pidgin developer, seanegen, (sorry lost the link somewhere). Basically, the reason behind this is that all the checks (e.g. Blacklists etc) are performed after one gets this signal, and hence they dont create the window otherwise it might be created even if you have blocked the person who is sending you the message. Perfect explanation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, what&amp;rsquo;s the solution. Simple..Use the &amp;ldquo;DisplayedImMessage&amp;rdquo; (or &amp;ldquo;displayed-im-message&amp;rdquo; signal) which is sent, once the conversation has been created. That&amp;rsquo;s it. Hope that this post benefit you.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Dropbox Online Storage Public/Shared Folders: A Word Of Caution</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/09/16/dropbox-online-storage-publicshared-folders-a-word-of-caution/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2008 14:26:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/09/16/dropbox-online-storage-publicshared-folders-a-word-of-caution/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update:&lt;/strong> In a &lt;a href="http://forums.getdropbox.com/topic.php?id=4207">thread about this post at Dropbox forums&lt;/a>, it was brought to my notice that Dropbox has now changed its &lt;a href="https://www.getdropbox.com/terms#terms">terms&lt;/a> to remove the objectionable clause.&lt;/p>

But before we begin, please make sure you have read Part 1 of my post, because here I&amp;rsquo;ll start from the point where we left off in the earlier post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I began thinking on the lines of setting up a ramdisk first (and remapping the browser cache folders to the new path in this ramdisk), so that nothing gets written to the hard disk, ever, even if the browser tries very hard. Best security right? Yes, but it involved a few issues like data is still there until you reboot also a part of your ram is always blocked, etc. So I went with the approach given below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Method: Easier and privacy on-par with Chrome/IE8&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just do the following in addition to the Step 4.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Uncheck &amp;ldquo;Keep my history&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Uncheck &amp;ldquo;Remember what I enter in forms and the search bar&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Uncheck &amp;ldquo;Remember what I&amp;rsquo;ve downloaded&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Choose &amp;ldquo;Keep until I close firefox&amp;rdquo; for cookies&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Press advanced settings in &amp;ldquo;Private Data&amp;rdquo;, select unselect options according to your choice. For max protection, select everything.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Open a new tab, and write &amp;ldquo;about:config&amp;rdquo; (without quotes) in address bar, press enter.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Search for &amp;ldquo;browser.cache.disk.enable&amp;rdquo; and set it to false&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Search for &amp;ldquo;browser.cache.offline.enable&amp;rdquo; and set it to false&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Done. You are secure and remember, this is just a one time setup, you won&amp;rsquo;t have to do this again and again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side Note: Usability is another concern. However, I think that is debatable and varies from user to user highly. The steps lined up in these 2 posts aren&amp;rsquo;t too hard to carry out and take around a minute to do, and is a one time effort. Now, compare this with option where you use google chrome and love its in-built incognito mode but then have to leave all the extensions and greasemonkey scripts of firefox behind which made browsing so much more accessible for you. Another path could be to use both the browsers. Anyways, I&amp;rsquo;ll not go further down this path. This is for you to decide what you feel is more usable for you :) . This is just something to say &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not impossible&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PS: If anyone is still curious about the ramdisk approach, let me know..&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Firefox Incognito Mode Is Here: Move Over Chrome/IE8</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/09/10/firefox-incognito-mode-is-here-move-over-chromeie8/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2008 17:49:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/09/10/firefox-incognito-mode-is-here-move-over-chromeie8/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update:&lt;/strong> Part 2 of this post is now up &lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/2008/09/11/firefox-incognito-private-browsing-mode-part-ii.html">here&lt;/a> to allay some of the drawbacks that were pointed out.&lt;/p>

You just need to devote less than one minute (yes, you read that right, less than one minute) to set it up. Well, actions are better than words, so here it goes:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step 1.) Run the following command to start the firefox profile manager.(In Linux, press Alt+F2 and in Windows, press Win+R to bring up the run dialogue box)&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>firefox -ProfileManager

&lt;p>Step 2.) Press “Create Profile” and enter “Incognito” (or a name of your choice) as your new profile name and press “Finish”.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Step 3.) Select “Incognito” profile and press “Start Firefox”.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Step 4.) Go to Edit-&amp;gt;Preferences-&amp;gt;Privacy. Select “Always clear my private data when I close Firefox” and unselect “Ask me before clearing private data”.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Step 5.) That’s it. Setup is done. Now, whenever you want to go undercover, run the following command&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>firefox -P Incognito -no-remote
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Note 1: You can run incognito mode and normal mode together simultaneously.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note 2: Its advised that you put the above command in a shortcut for easy/quick access.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Isn’t that simple? Now, can you roll back that drool factor of being able to go “undercover” in google chrome or Internet Explorer 8?&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Hack: Pidgin-Gtalk Connection Problems - Get Around The Corporate Firewall</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/09/08/hack-pidgin-gtalk-connection-problems-get-around-the-corporate-firewall/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2008 15:30:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/09/08/hack-pidgin-gtalk-connection-problems-get-around-the-corporate-firewall/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently wrote a simple answering machine program/plugin for pidgin and someone asked me to port it to 32 bit. So I fired up pidgin within my virtual box installation at work (as I have only a 64 bit machine at home) but couldn&amp;rsquo;t get it to connect. Tried all sorts of methods found over the net of changing ports etc, set port forwarding in Virtual Box NAT, even switched to using a bridged host interface but still no go. On a whim, installed pidgin in the host, i.e., windows and still the same issue. Hmm, interesting.. But wait, gtalk client works, then what gives.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>I recently wrote a simple answering machine program/plugin for pidgin and someone asked me to port it to 32 bit.

On a whim, installed pidgin in the host, i.e., windows and still the same issue. Hmm, interesting.. But wait, gtalk client works, then what gives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, after a bit of snooping around, discovered that it&amp;rsquo;s a special funda that my company employs (and probably yours too) to monitor your IM conversations. The server talk.google.com was redirected to another server set up by my company that masquerades as gtalk server and tries to act as a &amp;ldquo;Man In The Middle&amp;rdquo; to hijack your connection and listen to everything while you live in the fantasy that since its an &amp;ldquo;SSL encrypted&amp;rdquo; connection, everything is secure. However, &amp;ldquo;fortunately&amp;rdquo; pidgin refuses to connect here (More details in the end)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But as they say, rules are meant to be bent and broken. Here, is a simple way 3-step procedure to circumvent around this.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Open up your gtalk account settings in pidgin and go to Advanced tab.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Check &amp;ldquo;Force old port&amp;rdquo;, uncheck &amp;ldquo;plaintext auth&amp;rdquo; and uncheck &amp;ldquo;Require SSL/TLS&amp;rdquo;. Also change &amp;ldquo;Connect port&amp;rdquo; to 443.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>main&lt;/strong> part: Go to an online nslookup service and do an nslookup for talk.google.com. Put the IP that you get in place of &amp;ldquo;talk.google.com&amp;rdquo; in the settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s it. Go and chat away. (or if you want to know the reasoning behind this, hit the link below)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>More Details:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Skip this if you want, only for the people who are interested, here are some details on why pidgin does not connect in this situation and how you can find out if your company is using this tactic.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>How pidgin tries to connect to gtalk servers is that first it makes a connection to talk.google.com and gets and verifies the certificate from there. Then it tries to connect to gmail.com. Now there can be various situations:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>1.
1. Its unable to complete the transaction in the first place because you didn't use the port 443, so firewall blocks it hence it can't communand tries to fallback to plaintext authorization which is not supported by google and hence it fails.
2. You chose correct settings to go around firewall but now after verifying certificate, it just keeps &amp;quot;connecting&amp;quot;. Basically, it passes through the talk.google.com phase and then tries to connect to gmail.com (don't know why) and gets stuck on this step because the company is masquerading the gtalk server but not the gmail server.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>Look for the following symptoms to see if your company is doing &amp;ldquo;something&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>1.
1. Do &amp;quot;nslookup talk.google.com&amp;quot; in your command prompt (not through web), then say you get an IP x.y.z.w. Now do &amp;quot;nslookup x.y.z.w&amp;quot; again in command prompt. Now you will get the real name of the server that is your company's. Can try this for other IM servers as well (e.g. yahoo)
2. When pidgin asks you to verify the certificate, don't take it lightly. Just fetch and see the certificate and it'll definitely be pointing to some other domain.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Enough fundas for today. Let me know if this helped you out or if you have your own techniques of finding and circumventing around such stuff.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Apology For Bad Downloads</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/09/05/apology-for-bad-downloads/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2008 16:13:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/09/05/apology-for-bad-downloads/</guid><description>&lt;p>Guys, for the past few days if you downloaded any &amp;ldquo;.tar.gz&amp;rdquo; packages from this site (like my splert or shantz-xwinwrap tools), then you&amp;rsquo;d have got a corrupt package.

And if you boss is the one pinging you, you could direct the message towards your twitter account so that you get it as an SMS on your phone immediately.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>This is a simple tool I wrote a few months ago to turn Pidgin, everyone’s favourite multi-client Instant Messenger (works with gtalk, msn, yahoo, aim etc), into a &lt;strong>customized answering machine (and more)&lt;/strong> when you are away from your computer.

And if you boss is the one pinging you, you could direct the message towards your twitter account so that you get it as an SMS on your phone immediately.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Time is short, so here are the details:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Features:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Group based rule execution, each group can contain any number of email IDs&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Custom replies for each group.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Integrates with twitter and will forward the message to your twitter account (or send a direct message to some other account) if you so desire. (Temporarily disabled since Twitter has blocked their IM bot)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Runs as a separate process over d-bus instead of running as a pidgin plugin, so much lesser chances of crashing.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Prerequisites:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Pidgin &amp;gt; 2.4.1&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Linux&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Download:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Usage:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Unzip the attached package anywhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Either install using the deb package or just copy the splert binary and config.txt to a folder of your choice&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Modify the “config.txt” file according to your needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Run splert. (or run splert -h for checking out the available options though you wouldn’t need them most of the times)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Config File:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Config file fields and formats are explained fully in the sample config file included in the attached file. However, here is a very basic sample configuration:&lt;/p>

0.03 - Oct04 2008 -&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Added option to specify twitter bot id (e.g. &lt;a href="mailto:twitterspy@jabber.org">twitterspy@jabber.org&lt;/a>) using option &amp;ldquo;-t/-twitterbot&amp;rdquo;. However, you need to do any &amp;ldquo;extra&amp;rdquo; stuff manually. e.g. logging in using twlogin command with twitterspy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added option to specify the status when you want to send messages instead of just when being away. Use &amp;ldquo;-s/&amp;ndash;status&amp;rdquo; option to do this.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Pre-requisites:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Works only in linux, primarily because the motion detection software we are going to use here works only in linux, otherwise we can port the script to other platforms.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You should have &lt;a href="http://lavrsen.dk/twiki/bin/view/Motion/DownloadFiles">motion&lt;/a> installed. If you are using Debian/Ubuntu or one of their derivatives, this is as simple as typing&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo apt-get install motion
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Otherwise, just go to the link above and download.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How-to:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is very simple.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Download the zip file attached to this post and unzip somewhere preferably in your home directory.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Open your terminal/command prompt. &amp;ldquo;cd&amp;rdquo; to the folder where you unzipped the zip file.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Run the following command.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>motion -c ./motion.conf
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>Run the following(in a different terminal, after cd&amp;rsquo;ing to the same folder):&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>./shantz-locker.sh
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>And that&amp;rsquo;s it. See the magic (a pretty useless one, I admit :-D) happen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Options:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The shantz-locker.sh script takes a few options that you can use to customize the program according to your needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Usage: ./shantz-locker [-l &amp;lt;LockThreshold&amp;gt;] [-u UnlockThreshold] [-s LockScanInterval] [-t UnlockScanInterval]
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>#LockThreshold - Determines the threshold (based on no. of samples sans motion) to lock your PC. Default is 5
#UnlockThreshold - Determines the threshold (based on no. of samples with motion) to unlock your PC. Default is 2
#LockScanInterval - How soon to check if there is motion when your PC is in unlocked state. Default interval is 5 seconds
#UnlockScanInterval - How soon to check if there is motion when your PC is in locked state. Default interval is 2 seconds&lt;/p>

The call in question was _OSI(“Linux”). He goes on to say that the action the firmware takes, on finding out if the OS is linux, was probably inaccurate and it was good that linux kernel DOES NOT identify itself as “Linux” and returns false for the _OSI(“Linux”) and instead returns true when probed for Windows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That got me thinking, the first thought being that isn’t this a BIG flaw in the kernel. I mean, trying to make the firmware aware of the OS and doing things accordingly is a good thing, right? Vendors can provide workarounds for OS flaws in this way. e.g. the thermal critical temperature event workaround that HP has for Windows Vista. If we are just emulating Vista here, then aren’t we inheriting their bugs as well? But “Never make judgements straightaway”, I have learnt in the past. So, thought about reading it a bit more. After some googling around, I came to know the sound reasoning behind the decision.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Why not return true for _OSI(“Linux”)?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The difference between Linux and Windows is that the linux kernel is a continuously (and rapidly) moving target. When somebody probes for Windows 98 or Windows 2000 or Windows Vista, they can be sure about the behaviour, but Linux is too generic for us. The bug in one version of the kernel can be fixed in another one, and the behaviour changes, so one cannot rely on _OSI(“Linux”) as there is no generic/constant “Linux” interface.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>Why not then support _OSI(“Linux.xx.xx.xx”) or something equivalent to signify the kernel version?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This is also not reliable because which kernel would this be, the mainline, Ubuntu’s kernel, Fedora’s kernel, Suse’s kernel, or some user patched kernel? Moreover, the bugs fixed in later kernel versions are often backported to earlier versions by various distros. So, again one cannot rely on the kernel version as such, and there are just too many different kernel branches out there for a vendor to check against.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>Why to return true for something like _OS(“Windows 2006”)?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>What I found out is that they do it because most vendors do most checks only if they find Windows and hence, it becomes a necessity to return true for this, for now.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>But what does that mean, is it always going to remain the same?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Basically, what the kernel guys want is a better usage of the _OSI strings. They want the BIOS developers to check for a “capability” rather than a platform or platform version. Because consistent behaviour might be expected when checked for a platform like Windows (Actually its a platform + its version because there are separate strings for Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows NT, Windows Vista, etc) because they are slow moving targets with major changes to ACPI behaviour done only with the next version of the OS that is released after many years, but this is not true for faster targets like linux where changes happen often and can even be backported. So, essentially the situation will remain the same until vendors straighten out their code.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="5">
&lt;li>But is it justified for the linux developers/users to expect this to be followed by the vendors?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This is a tough question with no straight answer. Even though linux users are in minority but still they are significant in number, and if they pay the same money for the hardware as their windows counterparts, they should get the same level of firmware support as well. However, that said, it is also true that the vendors have to draw the line somewhere and given the rapidly changing behaviour of the kernel they cannot always be expected to keep up, especially with all the costs involved. Thats why the kernel community wants them to be aware of these inherent flaws in their design and move to a system (check for capability, not for platform) where they don’t have to “keep up” anymore. And meanwhile they absorb the strain into the kernel/drivers, emulating as Windows, and trying to make the workarounds for Windows bugs in their code instead. And they have started efforts to make the vendors aware of this linux peculiarity and are trying to document the linux behaviour&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reading material: Thomas Renninger wrote this doc” &lt;a href="ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/trenn/ACPI_BIOS_on_Linux_guide/acpi_guideline_for_vendors.pdf">ACPI BIOS Guideline For Linux&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m convinced with the reasoning. But as always, one man cannot look at all the angles and I might have missed the one that makes this all junk. Are you convinced too? Or do you have any other angle to provide?&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Site Updates</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/07/29/site-updates-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2008 18:16:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/07/29/site-updates-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just wanted to apologize to you guys for not updating this blog frequently as work load is becoming more and more these days.

But I&amp;rsquo;ll try my best to update as often as possible. There are a couple of useful apps that I wrote some time ago but havent found time to add all the features that I wanted and to roll them out, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll release them with the current feature set.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meanwhile, today I got some time free to finally update both my blogs to WordPress 2.6 and also update all the plugins to their latest versions. Don&amp;rsquo;t notice too much on the frontend, but the admin area seems much snappier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And as always, please let me know if there is anything specific that you want me to write about in near future.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>A Breath Of Fresh Air: My New Ubuntu Desktop</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/07/21/a-breath-of-fresh-air-my-new-ubuntu-desktop/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2008 18:54:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/07/21/a-breath-of-fresh-air-my-new-ubuntu-desktop/</guid><description>&lt;p>**UPDATE: **Surprisingly this post has found favour with “digg”ers :). Check the bottom of the post for some more info about the setup&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>UPDATE2&lt;/strong>: On popular demand, I&amp;rsquo;ve uploaded my .conkyrc. &lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/files/conkyrc.txt">Download Conky Configuration file by clicking here&lt;/a> and save as .conkyrc in your home folder.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After loitering around for so long, I finally got my lazy bum off the bed and installed Hardy Heron (8.04.1) onto my aging laptop. I’ve never been a sucker for eye-candy stuff, prefering to have more resources available for real work, instead of ooh-aahing over nice looking things all around my desktop. Well, but then I fell prey. I thought of giving another try to the thingamagic that compiz-fusion is, moreso since I didn’t have to go through loads of installing nuances like feisty because of it being already integrated in Hardy. An emerald install and a few minutes of tinkering later, I had a cool looking screen staring back at me. Here is a preview screenshot for your eyes but obviously the static screenshot wont show the amazing dynamic effects of CF. Let me see how many days I keep this up before going back to my plain-jane self.

&lt;p>Let me know if you have any suggestions to improve it further, or want more pics/vids of my new lappy in action, or have any of your own to share.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Update: Setup info:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Base Theme: Ubuntu Studio (basically for icon set. Download ubuntustudio-look package for this)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Controls : From Xenon theme (Inbuilt in Ubuntu)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Wallpaper is something named “lotus” or something. Downloaded from interfacelift.com&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Compiz Fusion with almost all effects turned on. Ofcourse you can’t see most of them in the still image&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Emerald theme engine for glassy and rounded window borders (Download “emerald” package)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Dock at the bottom is avant window navigator (awn. Download package avant-window-navigator)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>On right side, stats etc are from conky (Download package conky)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Misc: Turned transparency on for most things including gnome-terminal, gnome-panel, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Salient points:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The memory being consumed right now is around 850 MB. Thats with lots of applications, all CF effects turned on, most things having glass and transparent effects, and even my apache web server and mysql are running in background. And after that also, most memory (around 200 MB) is being eaten by firefox, leading to this high usage.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The setup boots up with just a shade over 300 MB being used, even though I’ve set CF and emerald on by default at boot and even apache and mysql start running on startup. :)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

Cool movie, though not as awesome as &amp;ldquo;Go to White Castle&amp;rdquo; one.

The poem is actually written by one &amp;ldquo;David Feinberg&amp;rdquo;. And it may sound too geeky or lame to most normal people, but then again, we all know that I ain&amp;rsquo;t no normal fella.

&lt;p>I fear that I will always be&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lonely number like root three&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The three is all that’s good and right,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why must my three keep out of sight&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beneath the vicious square root sign,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wish instead I were a nine&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For nine could thwart this evil trick,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>with just some quick arithmetic&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know I’ll never see the sun, as 1.7321&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Such is my reality, a sad irrationality&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When hark! What is this I see,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another square root of a three&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As quietly co-waltzing by,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Together now we multiply&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To form a number we prefer,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rejoicing as an integer&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We break free from our mortal bonds&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the wave of magic wands&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our square root signs become unglued&lt;/p>

Always give an exit path, a way to make it all go away, make it look like nothing happened. But Gnome seems to think otherwise. Any settings window you open, all you see is a “close” button.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I made a few changes and then tried to “undo” them by using the following methods:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Pressing the “close” button.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Pressing the little “x” on the upper right corner.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Pressing the “Escape” key.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Pressing “Alt+F4”.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>But no dice. Every method leads to saving of changes. The same thing occurs with EVERY dialogue box you can find in Gnome. I hate to say that this is something Windows seems to have got right (Maybe their UI designers are better than their OS programmers). What’s even more surprising is that even cross-platform apps (e.g. Firefox) give the “Apply” and “Cancel” buttons in Windows but not in Linux.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope Gnome developers listen and patch this up, or if there is any “hidden” tricks up your sleeve that will allow me to “go back in time”, please do let me know.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>My Brief History With Computers</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/06/23/my-brief-history-with-computers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2008 14:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/06/23/my-brief-history-with-computers/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’m going to be bespectacled and have been advised to reduce and limit my computer usage considerably.

&lt;p>HSDPA/HSUPA my a**. I mean what good is a “3G” device that doesn’t even let you use the potential of the hyper-speeds by connecting to your bigger machines or even doing video calls. Oh right, I forgot, now you can check your e-mail at 50 messages per minute, WOOHOO!!, I’m so l33t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far the only good things I’ve noticed about the new release are:The MobileMe aka “sync-with-anything-anywhere” service, which although paid (obviously, its Apple we are talking about here), is still interesting. And the new SDK 2.0 that promises the 3rd party devs the same access to the phone as Apple’s devs, seems to be a step in the right direction though it remains to be seen how much of this is actually followed up on by Apple.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, what do you feel is &lt;strong>THE&lt;/strong> revolutionary thing about this new Cupertino offering? And of course, chime in with your gripes as well.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Tip: Gadgets, Deals And Stuff You Need To Know - Part III</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/06/10/tip-gadgets-deals-and-stuff-you-need-to-know-part-iii/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2008 13:05:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/06/10/tip-gadgets-deals-and-stuff-you-need-to-know-part-iii/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is the last part in this series.

This time I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you some of the things that I do to find the best price for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Use Price Comparison Engines&lt;/strong>: These engines will let you search for your desired products and provide a comparison of the costs at which they are available at different stores online as well as offline. Two of my favourites are &lt;a href="http://www.pricegrabber.com/">Price Grabber&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://www.froogle.com/">Froogle&lt;/a>. Price Grabber has the added benefits of providing user reviews about the product as well.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>Last time we discussed &lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/2008/06/02/tip-gadgets-deals-and-stuff-you-need-to-know-part-i.html">how to select the gadget&lt;/a> that you want to buy. This time I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you some of the things that I do to find the best price for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

Price Grabber has the added benefits of providing user reviews about the product as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Deal Sites&lt;/strong>: Many sites across the web aggregate the latest deals. Some are run by the site owners, e.g., &lt;a href="http://www.deals2buy.com/">Deals2Buy&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://www.hotdealsclub.com/">HotDealsClub&lt;/a> etc, which are mostly almost same to each other. Some are run by the community, e.g. &lt;a href="http://slickdeals.net/">slickdeals&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://fatwallet.com/">fatwallet&lt;/a>, etc. These have an added advantage that the discussion that takes place on the original discussion adds a lot of value and insight in terms of how to stack on even better deals on top of it, provides comparison to other deals, rumours about coming deals in advance, and even deals local to your state, city or a particular store as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Bargain Sites&lt;/strong>: These sites sell overstocked products at a cheap price. Some of the popular ones are &lt;a href="http://overstock.com/">Overstock&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://www.smartbargains.com/">Smart Bargains&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://woot.com/">W00t&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://stootsi.com/">Stootsi&lt;/a>, etc. W00t and Stootsi are a bit different in the sense that they have very limited number of products available at a time for sale (generally just 1).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Coupon Codes Sites&lt;/strong>: Many sites aggregate coupon codes for various online and offline stores that you can use with your purchase to lower the price further. However, you need to go through the terms and conditions carefully as some coupons might be expired or might not work with your particular product.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mail In Rebates&lt;/strong>: Mail In Rebates are a great way to save a lot of money and even make money on buying things. Basically what you have to do is fill in a form and send it to a given address along with proof of purchase or UPC code. And anywhere between 2–10 weeks you’ll receive a check for the said amount. So, be on the lookout for mail in rebates on manufacturers’ or sellers’ sites. But beware that mail-in-rebates don’t have 100% reliability. They might take a lot of time and might not even come. So, you better depend on them only if you are in US for more than a few weeks and keep tracking them through your mail-in-rebates’ tracking site.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cash Back&lt;/strong>: Many sites give cash backs if you go to the seller’s site through them. An example for this is Fat Wallet.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Pricematch&lt;/strong>: This is a great weapon that most people don’t know about or don’t take into consideration. Many shops (generally brick n mortar ones) give a lowest price gaurantee and if you are getting a product at a cheaper rate some place else, they will give u a discount on the difference. e.g. Staples has a 110% price match policy, so if they sell smthing at 50$, and some other place sells it 40$, then they will give it to you for 50 – 1.1x(50–40) = 39$. But many shops will price match to offline shops online and some will consider online ones as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Use Your Mouth (and brains)&lt;/strong>: Don’t think wrong, you perverts ;). By mouth I mean “talking/conversing/convincing”. You can even negotiate prices at many places (Search for the BestBuy motto), and many times you need to convince the floor managers to allow you to stack on coupons after coupons over a product that is already being given at a discount and then get a couple of freebies as well ;).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Well, this is by no means a complete list but I’ve tried to list the most important ones atleast. If I missed out on something, or if you have your own strategies or sites you visit to get the best deals, please share it with us as well.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Tip: Gadgets, Deals And Stuff You Need To Know - Part I</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/06/02/tip-gadgets-deals-and-stuff-you-need-to-know-part-i/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2008 04:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/06/02/tip-gadgets-deals-and-stuff-you-need-to-know-part-i/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you are a gadget freak like me and can’t resist the temptations to buy the newest toy on the shelves, then you’d obviously want to eek out the maximum you can from whatever budget you have.

But while doing so you have to take care of a lot of things. Here is Part I of the few things that I do get the best deals out there while making sure I’m buying the right thing from the right place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first step to buying anything is obviously whether you are buying the right thing. The list of do’s and don’t and this regard are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Do not blindly go by the what the manufacturer’s site says. After all I’ll always say that I my product is the best.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Do not just make the decision based on the feature set. More features mean more possible points of failure, so a device with fewer features but better reliability is obviously much better than the one that promises the moon but only the “once in a blue -“ kinds.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Make sure to search for similar products from other manufacturers. Just because it comes from Apple’s stable doesn’t make it the best. (For the record, in general, I don’t like anything that comes from Cupertino)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Look for the reviews. Search for the reviews for the product you have in mind, but a big problem with this has now arisen with the advent of “paid reviews”. But of course, you can always turn towards the community. Read through all the site-based single person reviews as well but also look for forums and other communities related to the type of gadget you have in mind. e.g. – For cameras, DPReview is a good place to go, for WM smart phones, XDA-Developers is the place to be, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Is the after-sales support good? You don’t want to be locked out with a product that you can’t do anything about if something goes wrong.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Look also for the hidden costs of product. Many a times the base product is cheap but then it requires you to shell out a fortune in terms of required accessories to yield it’s full potential (e.g. Archos players).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Maintenance costs:e.g. Most Apple products dont have easily replaceable parts and need to be sent back to factory for even things like a new battery.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now, the list above seems small but when put into practice it isn’t. But obviously, a geek who can handle all the latest electronic gizmos can surely handle the irks that come while chosing one, and of course, within a short while, it will become second nature to you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Are there any other things that you look for buying your new boy-toy? Do let me know. Next time, we will look at how to get the best deals for the stuff you crave.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Google's New Favicon</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/05/30/googles-new-favicon/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2008 19:16:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/05/30/googles-new-favicon/</guid><description>&lt;p>It’s amazing, isn’t it?

Folks, here it is, the 5 comic strips that I love the most (in no particular order):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>1. &lt;a href="http://dilbert.com/">Dilbert&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>: Our friendly neighbourhood engineer is in town. Have fun reading through his daily life&amp;rsquo;s traumas. Of course, his tragedies couldn&amp;rsquo;t be as funny without the able support of the likes of Wally, Asok, dogbert, catbert, and yeah the &amp;ldquo;pointy haired manager&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2. &lt;a href="http://xkcd.com/">XKCD&lt;/a>:&lt;/strong> Don&amp;rsquo;t know if this is the abbreviated form of something but the author calls it a webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language. You&amp;rsquo;d be frowning at your monitor screen right now, trying to understand the relation between these things but you know the saying, There is the biggest order behind the biggest chaos (or something, I just made up that saying just now :-) )&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**3. &lt;a href="http://userfriendly.org/">Userfriendly&lt;/a>: **This is a story about a small ISP with your regular, average joe, sys-admins having a fun time at the expense of their unsuspecting management and, of course, about Pitr who has bigger plans for world domination than even google.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**4. &lt;a href="http://www.cad-comic.com/">Ctrl+Alt+Del&lt;/a>: **Your last resort on Windows is now your daily appetite in the form of this little story about (mis)adventures of a group of nerdy friends who just love to get into trouble, all while playing that game of Halo with one hand (and that too tied behind their backs).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>5. &lt;a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/">Penny Arcade&lt;/a>:&lt;/strong> If you are a gamer, you can&amp;rsquo;t miss this. Even &amp;ldquo;Jack Thomson&amp;rdquo; couldn&amp;rsquo;t, so you know, this one is a keeper ;-).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, go and have a nice time and yeah, don&amp;rsquo;t forget to tell me about what are your favourite tech comics.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>TIP: Viewing Any PDF Online, Without A PDF Reader And For Free</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/05/23/tip-viewing-any-pdf-online-without-a-pdf-reader-and-for-free/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2008 21:42:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/05/23/tip-viewing-any-pdf-online-without-a-pdf-reader-and-for-free/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just a small tip. If you want to view a pdf and you don’t have adobe acrobat (or any other pdf reader) installed, e.g., you are sitting in a cyber cage or at a friend’s place, you can still view it.
Only thing you have to do is, just prefix the url to the online pdf with &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://www.scribd.com/vacuum?url">http://www.scribd.com/vacuum?url&lt;/a>=&amp;rdquo; and you’ll see a nice web interface rendering your pdf without having to install anything on your PC.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>Just a small tip.

But many people, mostly those who are new to Ubuntu, and even a few who are already using it, are not sure what LTS really means.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>With the recent release of Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron), a lot of hype was generated (Overhype or well-deserved, that’s for another post). One of the main highlights of all the stories, news and reviews doing the rounds are that this is an LTS version. But many people, mostly those who are new to Ubuntu, and even a few who are already using it, are not sure what LTS really means.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Literally expanded, it stands for &lt;strong>Long Term Support&lt;/strong>. Yeah right, but what does it actually mean. Does it mean I’ll keep getting updates till eternity or what? The explanation is quite simple really.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Long Term:&lt;/strong> What it means is that while a normal non-LTS is supported for 18 months, an LTS version will be supported for 3 years or 36 months (and 5 years for the server version).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Support: **Now, don’t just jump into downloading it and installing on reading the long term part. This DOES NOT mean that you’ll continue getting newer versions of favourite software packages till that time. This only means that you’ll continue getting “security updates” for 3 (or 5) years. What’s the difference, some might ask, as they think that the newest version of a software is the most secure. However it is not so. A newer version may bring more features, but also more code to become vulnerable to bugs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, in a nutshell, to understand the situation, let’s take an example. If Hardy has a software X with version 1.3, and after 2 years the software moves to version 2.5, you’ll not be able to get version 2.5 from the hardy repositories but a version “1.x-ubuntuy”, which will have all the security and major bug fixes for that software, but not the new features that you might see in later versions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I just did this post so that people don’t jump into it by getting a wrong impression about LTS and later on be disappointed on learning the fact. So, now you can make an informed decision.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Fill Your Password To Invite Your Buddies - Not So Fast!!</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/05/16/fill-your-password-to-invite-your-buddies-not-so-fast/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2008 21:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/05/16/fill-your-password-to-invite-your-buddies-not-so-fast/</guid><description>&lt;p>For the past many years, I’ve seen a trend that has been on a meteoric rise. Whatever new service you sign on for on the internet (especially the web2.0–oh-so-cool-you-have-to-tell-everyone-about-it ones), it gives you an option to fill in your e-mail ID and password and makes a generous offer of letting all your friends know about your new avatar and let them all join in the fun. Most of the people around me, it seems, don’t think twice before gladly accepting the offer, as is made apparent from the increasing amount of automated mails I’m getting with subjects like “Hey, don’t be left out! Join me on X” or “Hi SG, Why don’t you follow me on Y”.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>For the past many years, I’ve seen a trend that has been on a meteoric rise.

Join me on X” or “Hi SG, Why don’t you follow me on Y”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I just wanted to “remind” you all (because you already know it) how important your password is. You keep it safe from everyone, suspect even your friends of trying to hack into your e-mail, and then you give it away to an “unknown” entity with so much of ease, laying so much trust onto it that you won’t even put in your biological parents.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While many of these services are genuine, but many might not be. I’m certainly against handing out your passwords to a third-party web service until it is something like google that won’t just sell you off one fine day and run off somewhere you can’t find it. But if you are compelled to do so because of some reason, I’d recommend atleast checking out what it has to say about the data it’s collecting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let me take an example of a new IM service that I recently came across. It’s called IMO (or imo or whatever) and is apparently quite popular because of its multiple IM service connections through a single interface. I thought of checking out its terms etc and making a mental image of how respectable / trustworthy I found it. I had listed the following things on the blog where I had found about this site. Listing them here again for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following are the nuggets I found:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>1.&lt;/strong> They have a blogspot blog. It takes hardly a few minutes to host ur own blog on ur own domain. Maybe they have some existing google connection but yet to discover it.(I read somewhere that some of these people worked at google in the past but that’s no reason to keep your blog on such a platform)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2.&lt;/strong> Shady privacy agreement.
** 2a** They mention that not only will they save ur username and pwd but may also save ur chats/messages etc.
** 2b** They might also share info with 3rd parties (written in a manner that they can do it on their own will)
** 2c** Transparency: They might not even tell u whats going on if they so decide.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please don’t mention about the eliteness of their “advisor panel”. This is the biggest marketing gimmick that everyone pulls off. Many times the &amp;ldquo;advisors&amp;rdquo; don&amp;rsquo;t even know the &amp;ldquo;advised&amp;rdquo; company exists.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>IMP:&lt;/strong> If a site doesn’t say anything or says all goody things in its terms, that doesn’t make it clean, but if you find suspiciousness in the terms, that definitely makes a negative mark. &lt;strong>In Short, when your password is concerned, treat everyone guilty until proven innocent.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Keep Tab On Home Security With A Webcam And Twitter</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/05/14/keep-tab-on-home-security-with-a-webcam-and-twitter/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2008 04:00:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/05/14/keep-tab-on-home-security-with-a-webcam-and-twitter/</guid><description>&lt;p>Worried about someone breaking into your house in your absence?

And you are set for real time updates through twitter about all that goes on at your abode behind your back (can even receive a text message/sms on your phone). Keep reading for the very simple setup you need.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Download and install &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://www.lavrsen.dk/twiki/bin/view/Motion/DownloadFiles">motion&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; on your computer. For ubuntu users, this is as simple as running&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo apt-get install motion
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Setup your motion configuration file. (Usually at /etc/motion/motion.conf). There are quite a lot of options available. You might want to tweak it a lot according to ur needs later on but the most important ones that you can begin with are (leave the rest untouched for now):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>a. Add/edit the option &amp;ldquo;target_dir&amp;rdquo; to point to the directory where you want to save the images of the event when motion is detected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>b. Add/edit the option &amp;ldquo;locate&amp;rdquo; and set it to &amp;ldquo;on&amp;rdquo; so that you get a nice square box around the detected moving object/person.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>c. Add/edit the option &amp;ldquo;webcam_port&amp;rdquo; and set it to, say, &amp;ldquo;8000&amp;rdquo;. Motion includes a mini http server so now, you can use it to view the actual images of the happening when you get the update and check for false alarms.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Now, comes the most important part, about getting the update.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>motion has an option called &amp;ldquo;on_motion_detected&amp;rdquo; and here you can specify any command or program that you want to run when motion is detected. To get the update on your twitter account, use one of the following three methods with this option.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>a. Using curl. If you have curl installed in your system, then you can use the following value for the on_motion_detected option:&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>curl -u yourusername:yourpassword -d status&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;Motion Detected! Check Immediately&amp;#34;&lt;/span> https://twitter.com/statuses/update.xml
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>b. Using wget. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have curl, you can even use wget with the following command:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>wget --post-data &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;status=Motion Detected! Check Immediately&amp;#34;&lt;/span> --http-user&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>yourusername --http-password&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>yourpassword https://twitter.com/statuses/update.xml -O /dev/null
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>c. Using my perl script. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have curl as well as wget, you can even use my perl script (attached below) for this. The value will now be:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>/path/to/script/twitter.pl &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;Motion Detected! Check Immediately&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>Now connect your webcam and start motion (Just type &amp;ldquo;motion&amp;rdquo; on command line and press enter). Wait for someone to break in, or just roam around in front of the camera yourself and have fun as you receive a message on your phone about the &amp;ldquo;motion&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>PS: For receiving a text message on your phone, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to turn on the &amp;ldquo;Device Updates&amp;rdquo; option in your twitter account, otherwise you need to open the twitter web page to check the status.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The script: &lt;a href="http://tech.shantanugoel.com/resources/downloads/twitter.pl">Twitter Updating Perl Script&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let me know if you put this to some other exciting uses or have any questions about the method described above.&lt;/p>

And if you want to make this change permanent so that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to run these commands everytime you want to use your webcam, all you have to do is add the following line to your /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist file&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>blacklist zc0301&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This would prevent the module from loading whenever you connect your webcam to your computer.

Everyone ooh&amp;rsquo;ed and aah&amp;rsquo;ed while ogling at it until they realized that HTC has taken a step back (or forward towards matching Apple&amp;rsquo;s iPhone crap) by removing the expansion card slot from the phone. Yes, it has 4 GB of internal storage but I&amp;rsquo;d rather have an SDHC card slot with the ever falling prices of solid state memory (an 8 GB Class 6 SDHC card is worth not more than around 60$ these days).

The do-it-all-be-all-end-all phone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, my prediction is (Nostradamus style) : **NEVER. **No sir, you are not going to see your dream phone any time soon, or any time at all, for that matter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why do I say that. The reasons are pretty obvious, once we take off our wishful thinking hats and don the smart thinking ones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**1. ****A new dream every day: **Around 8-10 years ago, I wished I had a cell phone. Around 6 years ago, I wish I had one with a camera. Around 4 years ago, I wish I had a phone with Mp3 player and expandable memory. 3 years ago I wished for a smart phone. Now, I wish for&amp;hellip;. You get it. By the time something comes out, our dreams have already moved on. After all they  aren&amp;rsquo;t called &amp;ldquo;dreams&amp;rdquo; just like that ;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**2. Where is the money: **You might be ready to give a fortune (and your first born son) for that ultimate phone, but the evil-phone-conglomerate wants much more than that. They want you to be slaves. They don&amp;rsquo;t want the world to spend a huge amount in one go and then stop. They need to mint more money and too much more frequently than you&amp;rsquo;d like to spend. This is why the strategy works. Give out a phone that has slim form factor, nice UI, wi-fi, but then make the processor crappy (Touch), then lure them with a better processor but take out the wi-fi (Touch Dual), Add the wi-fi back and slap in a keyboard too, but keep&amp;rsquo;em wanting for &lt;a href="http:///2008/01/28/htc-the-best-windows-mobile-business-unit.html">better graphics&lt;/a> (Kaiser), give &amp;rsquo;em a shiny new toy, but then lock it down in every possible (iCrap). So, you&amp;rsquo;d be stuck in the vicious circle of &amp;ldquo;upgrades&amp;rdquo; and keep the phone factory churning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, my dear fellow phone lovers, stop wasting your time waiting for that ultimate phone, and go &amp;ldquo;upgrade&amp;rdquo; at once, because &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rdquo; phone with just &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rdquo; one more feature&amp;hellip;ISN&amp;rsquo;T COMING&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Want To Program Smartly In C? Use GLib</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/05/03/smart-programming-in-c-using-glib/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 May 2008 15:30:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/05/03/smart-programming-in-c-using-glib/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>GLib - An Introduction:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://library.gnome.org/devel/glib/">GLib&lt;/a> is a utility library for C, which augments the standard C library in several purposeful ways to make your life that much easier while programming. GLib has the following things to offer you:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**1. Portability: **The main issue that haunts any C developer is the portability of code. One cannot rely on the standard C library for this as you may find many functions that work differently under different platforms are aren&amp;rsquo;t there at all sometimes. GLib ensures that the all the functionality exposed by it remains consistent across platforms, so that you can rest assured that your code will work the way its supposed to work irrespective of the Operating System it&amp;rsquo;s being used for (Of course, this assumes that you have ensured about portability aspects of your non-GLib related source code). Moreover, GLib is available for a vast array of contemporary Operating Systems including GNU/Linux, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>&lt;strong>GLib - An Introduction:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://library.gnome.org/devel/glib/">GLib&lt;/a> is a utility library for C, which augments the standard C library in several purposeful ways to make your life that much easier while programming. GLib has the following things to offer you:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**1. Portability: **The main issue that haunts any C developer is the portability of code. One cannot rely on the standard C library for this as you may find many functions that work differently under different platforms are aren&amp;rsquo;t there at all sometimes. GLib ensures that the all the functionality exposed by it remains consistent across platforms, so that you can rest assured that your code will work the way its supposed to work irrespective of the Operating System it&amp;rsquo;s being used for (Of course, this assumes that you have ensured about portability aspects of your non-GLib related source code). Moreover, GLib is available for a vast array of contemporary Operating Systems including GNU/Linux, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**2. Security: **Though you still need to be careful about things like freeing allocated memories properly, etc but GLib does ensure that all its functionality is secure. Moreover, GLib has a policy of ensuring that all its functions are threadsafe. This saves you from a lot of checks and balances and locks and scheduling considerations if you had written all this yourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>3. Useful Data Types:&lt;/strong> GLib exposes a lot of data types. Some are very basic that maintain portability across OS&amp;rsquo;s and 32-bit and 64-bit systems. e.g. you can rest assured that gint32 will always be 32 bit and gint64 will always be 64 bit data types.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apart from this, it also provides a lot of derived data types e.g. singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, hash tables, stacks, queues, trees, and much more. It&amp;rsquo;d basically cover most of you data structure needs that you&amp;rsquo;d have otherwise had to implement yourselves. And it also provides helper functions that makes working with them so much more easier. If you have ever used Perl, and have wished that C programming could be a bit faster like it, you will be pleasantly surprised.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**4. Utility Functions: **GLib also provides various utility functions to ease out your manipulation of data. Some of the functions are meant as more secure and portable replacements for those provided with standard C library, while rest are meant to provide other useful functionality which you earlier had to implement in your code. Some of the major areas covered by GLib&amp;rsquo;s utility functions are String manipulation, character set manipulation and conversion (including unicode and base64), using regular expressions, file manipulation, shell functions, config file parsing (my favourite), etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>End Note:&lt;/strong> I can understand that there would be a lot of people who believe that use of GLib is dumbing down programming in C. After all, we take pride being in control of our code and this is why we love progrmming in C because we have options to do things in our own way. Yes, that is all true but there comes a time where you&amp;rsquo;d like to spend more time in developing the core functionality of your app, or focus more on giving a rapid shape to your new idea, rather than reinventing the wheel and fumbling around with writing the helper functions. So, keeping that in mind I believe GLib is wonderful piece of code that has enabled me to churn out new apps that much faster.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Http 406 Errors Galore</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/05/01/http-406-errors-galore/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2008 15:30:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/05/01/http-406-errors-galore/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you have ever had these errors or just want to be prepared in case they pop up somtime (and they surely will), then read on as I discuss various situations that lead to them and also their solutions.&lt;/p>

The quick resolution was to include the following lines in my .htaccess:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&amp;lt;ifmodule mod_security.c&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>SecFilterEngine Off
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>SecFilterScanPOST Off
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&amp;lt;/ifmodule&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Sure enough, I put them in, published the post, and it worked. But since this meant opening up my site to the real hacking attempts, I commented them out and went about my work, occassionally turning them on as and when required.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, a few days ago, after a server upgrade, the problem reared its head again, and in a more vicious manner. I started getting the dreaded 406 error again, and this time for any post, even a blank post, and through all clients. But this time, TinyMCE was working without issues. A little bit of looking around my site told me that the problem was that my desktop clients were not able to connect to my &amp;ldquo;x mlrpc.php&amp;rdquo; file which is responsible for taking care of all the remote api provided by WordPress. Trying to access it through any means provided the 406 error. My site&amp;rsquo;s error log was filled with:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>An appropriate representation of the requested resource /x mlrpc.php could not be found on this server.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Now, the xml rpc methods are used not just by WordPress but many other CMS&amp;rsquo;s (like drupal, joomla, etc) and sure enough a quick search resulted in many similar reports for all the platforms. Enabling my previous mod_security options resulted in &amp;ldquo;503: Server misconfiguration&amp;rdquo; errors, complicating things further.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On seeing the error logs, I found that the server could not understand the options, and then I discovered that the mod_security had been upgraded to and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t backward compatible with old options. Modifying the options to their latest counterparts also didn&amp;rsquo;t work, as further wading through mod_security manual told me that now, its options cannot be overridden through .htaccess and can only be changed by the web admin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I found that my host has basically blocked the x mlrpc.php file from being accessed at all instead of using proper rules for blocking only the attacks while allowing valid accesses. This was the problem that a huge number of people are also having and moreover they (like me) are not able to convince their hosts to switch to proper rules.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, not all hope is lost. I have &amp;ldquo;fixed&amp;rdquo; this issue with a workaround for now. It is pretty simple really. Just rename your x mlrpc.php to something else (e.g. myrpc123.php) and also replace all references to it in your CMS with your new file name. You can use sed to automate this task. I used perl however:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>perl -e 's/x mlrpc.php/myrpc123.php/gi' -p -i *&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, the 406 errors should be gone. If this worked for you, or you had any issues let me know. Also, if you have any other workarounds/fixes of your own, do drop me a word.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note:&lt;/strong> In the above article, please ignore the space between &amp;ldquo;x&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;mlrpc&amp;rdquo; as the mod_security rules prevent them from being in content also. Moreover, use some unique name for rpc file.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Page Rank 7: True Or Google Glitch?</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/30/page-rank-7-true-or-google-glitch/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2008 20:33:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/30/page-rank-7-true-or-google-glitch/</guid><description>&lt;p>I installed google toolbar (linux version) today in firefox and for this blog, it says that its page rank is &lt;strong>7&lt;/strong>.

Won&amp;rsquo;t discuss tuxpaint here cuz I found it a little too kiddish.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>gpaint: (Available in Ubuntu repositories) gpaint is a very simplistic program that has a mspaint look and feel but feels a bit lacking. It can do basic procedures like basic shape selections, lines, boxes but that&amp;rsquo;s it. No polygon selections, brush, color picker, etc, and yeah no arrows. Moreover, it saves only in pngs.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/gpaint.png">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/gpaint-thumb.png" alt="gpaint screenshot">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>kolourpaint: (Available in Ubuntu Repositories) kolourpaint is very close to mspaint. Infact it does a bit more than mspaint. It has all the things that I mentioned as missing in gpaint, plus has basic image manipulation effects as well. I liked it quite a bit, but it had 2 drawbacks for me, still no arrows, and it depends on KDE/Qt libraries.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/kolourpaint.png">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/kolourpaint-thumb.png" alt="kolourpaint screenshot">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>mtpaint: (Available in Ubuntu Repositories from Gutsy onwards. Rest of the folks can search for a package on net, or find a suitable package or source &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=155874&amp;amp;package_id=173703">here&lt;/a>) This is the software that got me most excited. It is actually a kind of lower-intermediate package that lies somewhere between mspaint and a very basic, poor man&amp;rsquo;s GIMP. It has all the features ok kolourpaint, (plus arrows at last :-) ), a small smattering of basic effects (gaussian, edge detection, blur, embossing), can work with gifs also (handles transparency and animation quite well). So, this is the one I would be sticking to for now.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/mtpaint.png">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/mtpaint-thumb.png" alt="mtpaint screenshot">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am using mtpaint now for my basic needs. Hope the article benefitted you as well. If I missed out on some package, then do let me know.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>ImageMagick: Weaving Magic With Your Pictures</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/26/imagemagick-weaving-magic-with-your-pictures/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2008 06:23:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/26/imagemagick-weaving-magic-with-your-pictures/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’ve known about ImageMagick tools for quite some time now but never dabbled with it.

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It has almost unlimited features to manipulate your images through its tools like convert, montage, mogrify etc and their long list of options.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It is available for Windows, Linux and Mac as well.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>I’ve known about ImageMagick tools for quite some time now but never dabbled with it.

&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It is available for Windows, Linux and Mac as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Runs on web servers also (most of those nifty image sites use it for run time image manipulation)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It is amazingly fast.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Runs on the command line, which means batching of operations can be done and is also good for butter fingered people like me who are clumsy with GUI based image manipulation programs&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Has modules for interfacing with C, perl, php, C++, C#, java, etc. So, you can create your own applications around it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It’s FREE (as in speech and as in beer)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It has an amazing documentation over at imagemagick.org and also a very thriving community, so help is just a few clicks away.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As a very rudimentary sample of what it can do for you, take a look at my blog’s header above. I just gave it a few pics and ran a command, and it resized them, turned them into polaroid pics, rotated them at random angles, made the background transparent, strung them together to make a webpage header/banner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since the command was specific for the number and names of images, I made a simple perl script to automate the command making process so you can also download this script (link at the end of post) and run it to create your own header. (You might want to tweak the $w and $h variables in the script to specify your header’s width and height). Running it would be like&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>./pano.pl &amp;lt;imagenames&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>e.g.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>./pano.pl myimages/*
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>After I made this script, I came across &lt;a href="http://stason.org/photos/gallery/">Stas Bekman’s photo gallery&lt;/a> which has a much better and cool stack effect with photos. And he generously agreed to share his script (much more sophisticated than my my few lines) with me. His script is also attached below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let me know if you use any of these scripts (as it is or after modifying them) to create any cool effects.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>5 Reasons I Like Linux (And 5 Why I Dislike It)</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/19/5-reasons-i-like-linux-and-5-why-i-dislike-it/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2008 20:20:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/19/5-reasons-i-like-linux-and-5-why-i-dislike-it/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Disclaimer Notes:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I wrote this because these things just came into my mind today while I was reading about the impending &amp;ldquo;Hardy Heron&amp;rdquo; release related things and saw that there is a lot of FUD being spread still. So, thought of jotting down my likes/dislikes and not making it a linux v/s windows campaign. Though at a few places, it might be necessary to compare the two just to put things into perspective.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>These are reasons why &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>I&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo; like/dislike Linux and not why others might like/dislike it although you might find common patterns.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Most of my recent experience is with Ubuntu these days, so most examples would be from it as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>These reasons are purely from an end-user&amp;rsquo;s perspective and not from a linux developer&amp;rsquo;s perspective. So, I&amp;rsquo;m not taking into factor that I can change the kernel (or most other things&amp;rsquo;) source code because &amp;ldquo;generally&amp;rdquo; I don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>This post is quite long. And if you have a flame to send out my way (which you are most welcome to do), please read it in its entirety before doing so, because many things I say at some point have some caveats covered at another point.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>5 Reasons why I like Linux:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Light on Resources&lt;/strong>: I must say that Linux is what still keeps my more than 3 years old laptop running in a prim condition with the latest and greatest of everything from technology stand-point as well as eye-candy stuff. An example: With almost every effect of Compiz Fusion turned on, hordes of screenlets and AWN enabled, an Apache/MySQL/PHP based server running, and a dozen of other applications (firefox, nautilus, terminal, GIMP, RhythmBox, Open Office Word Processor, VLC player, etc) open, my setup consumes around 500 MB of RAM. While on the other hand, if I was using Vista, It&amp;rsquo;d have demanded atleast 1 GB of RAM just to run Aero, forget about the rest of the things.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cost&lt;/strong>: This is a big factor for me. Almost everything is free or atleast has a free alternative available. Most of the times I&amp;rsquo;ve found these free software to be much better than commercial software in terms of feature sets as well as stability. But even otherwise, when there are cases where the free alternative a bit lagging as compared to the commercial one (e.g. GIMP v/s Photoshop), I haven&amp;rsquo;t felt that my needs have ever outgrown the free software.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Ease of Use&lt;/strong>: Doing &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo; on linux is just so easy. By &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo;, I mean everything from doing some normal day chores, downloading files, customizing things, automating routine tasks, etc. The backbone for this is &amp;ldquo;the terminal&amp;rdquo; (not the movie :P). I can do almost anything I want from the console. It not only saves me time and frustration in executing a program, waiting for the GUI to load and then go through a series of clicks but also allows me to batch up everything into one pretty little command. Moreover, every thing has so many options that I can configure to my liking. (More on the &amp;ldquo;options&amp;rdquo; later below)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Getting Software&lt;/strong>: Getting software couldn&amp;rsquo;t be more easy.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It generally involves typing in &lt;code>sudo apt-get install &amp;lt;software&amp;gt;&lt;/code>, pressing enter, and that&amp;rsquo;s it. The latest version is ready to roll on your machine.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Reboots are minimal. Even after thinking for quite long, it&amp;rsquo;s very hard to recall any time when I had to &amp;ldquo;log-off&amp;rdquo; my system (let alone reboot) after installing a software (or even a driver)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Updates are automatic, and not just for the OS or a few core components, but for all the software that I installed through repositories (but not for the ones which I installed from my local deb&amp;rsquo;s or compilations, which is understandable of course)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The latest fixes/patches are available very quickly. Moreover, the revision cycle for most distros lies between 6–12 months and hence, even a complete desktop upgrade is quickly available as well (as compared to the 7 year period after which Vista came out). You can even &amp;ldquo;upgrade&amp;rdquo; to the latest distro revision without having to wipe everything, though I generally prefer a clean install.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Security&lt;/strong>: Now, I agree with everyone that the reason why we don&amp;rsquo;t see many viruses for linux is because the user base is very less as compared to other OS&amp;rsquo;s but I also believe that this is not the &amp;ldquo;only&amp;rdquo; reason.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The thing is that since most of the software is open source, so exploits are found quite quickly and patched and released rapidly. While in a closed source environments, even if a white hat reports it, the exploits go on un-noticed, un-worked upon by the developers (A good example is the recent falling of Vista during the &amp;ldquo;Pwn to Own&amp;rdquo; contest because of a known but unpatched vulnerability by Adobe, not a fault of Vista in this case though but you get my drift).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The security model otherwise is also quite tight and its very hard for someone to exploit it till the time you use common sense along with it. (A linux virus can easily wipe your &amp;ldquo;/home&amp;rdquo; without acquiring root permissions).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>5 Reasons why I dislike Linux&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These reasons irk me the most but aren&amp;rsquo;t enough for to make me move away from Linux. I mention them because getting them right would make my Linux expereince that much more joyful and probably others feels the same too. Moreover, this is not a gripe and is not a command/order to &amp;ldquo;the Linux guys&amp;rdquo; out there to fix it, because linux is of, by and for the community. And being a part of this community, I share the burden of this equally and would like to help out in making it better in whatever ways possible, developing, testing, suggesting things.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Getting Software:&lt;/strong> I had mentioned about how easy it is to get software from most distros&amp;rsquo; repositories with a single command. However, getting and installing software is also a challenge that many people face in linux. After sometime your particular version of the distro stops updating the software and will include only security fixes and such. Now, there are many good people who would backport software for your version but not all the time. You can download pacakges off the internet (debs&amp;rsquo; for ubuntu) but they might not work because of too many inter-mingled dependencies. Compiling is another option but many times, it can spiral out of hand. I hope we can better softwares like GDebi that could make this much more easier.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Options:&lt;/strong> Earlier I listed having so many options as one of my reasons to like Linux. But, sometimes, too many options tend to get to my head. This gets even more difficult when you have too many choices but no clue about what means what and which one is the best. However, the community is continously trying to make this right. A lot of documentation projects are going on, and the mailing lists, IRC networks and other forums also give out a lot of information. Especially for Ubuntu, I find a huge community based support system which always helps me out. (PS – The Ubuntu Forums are the nicest forums you&amp;rsquo;ll ever come across. I am yet to come across a post that contains words like &amp;ldquo;RTFM&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;n00b&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Ease Of Use:&lt;/strong> Some times, just some times, the lack of a GUI for common things irks me and I wish in respect of a few things (read wi-fi) that things could &amp;ldquo;just work&amp;rdquo;. But I guess this is a trade-off that I can live with, and moreover this situation is also improving especilly due to the efforts taken by Ubuntu, Mandriva, Fedora, GNOME and KDE. (Special thanks to nm-applet ;-) ). Moreover, Hardy Heron, b43 and the latest linux kernels promise to solve the wi-fi setup issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Browsing&lt;/strong>: The browsing experience on linux isn&amp;rsquo;t too great. But this is not a fault of Linux as such. This is due to companies providing adequate linux support (e.g. java plugins for 64 bit) and too many sites optimizing their code for IE. But again, there is hope for this as we can already run IE on linux (IEs4Linux) plus SUN has promised a 64 bit java firefox plugin with the next JRE.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Drivers:&lt;/strong> This is again due to companies not giving proper linux support for their hardware and not even releasing their hardware details for the OSS community to develop their own drivers. However, I can understand that giving out hardware details might not be an option for these companies considering the competition, and also proper software support might be a bit unfeasible due to a smaller consumer base. But again, more and more companies are seeing the light now and releasing proper drivers for linux, with Nvidia and ATi taking the lead (When will Creative listen?). And a special thanks to the OSS community for making working drivers despite all this.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>So, this is it. After reading back through what I just wrote, I am dead sure that I will stick to Linux as the trade-offs are too meagre for me. Will you?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Hack:Disabling the Message Box In Oxios Memory Apps (Windows Mobile)</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/15/hackdisabling-the-message-box-in-oxios-memory-apps-windows-mobile/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2008 08:43:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/15/hackdisabling-the-message-box-in-oxios-memory-apps-windows-mobile/</guid><description>&lt;p>**Update: **Modified the &amp;ldquo;Oxios Hibernate&amp;rdquo; app as well on public demand. Please redownload the below mentioned package. It now has Oxios Close as well as Oxios Hibernate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oxios developed a very useful tool for Windows Mobile (WM2003/5/6/6.1) called &amp;ldquo;Oxios Memory&amp;rdquo; sometime ago. On running it, it&amp;rsquo;ll flush your RAM (kind of) and recover substantial amounts of memory that can be used by the currently program. It is so good at this that many people run it regularly on their phones, and most of them want to run it in an automated mode (through a scheduler or a script). But the problem (so far) was that it generates a Message Box at the end for which the user has to press &amp;ldquo;OK&amp;rdquo; button to make it go away. There is no known way of disabling this message box and many attempts to work around it by scripting the &amp;ldquo;press OK&amp;rdquo; action have been very unreliable at best. Hence, it took it upon me today to remove this nagging problem and 5 minutes later we have a &amp;ldquo;clean&amp;rdquo; Oxios Memory.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>**Update: **Modified the &amp;ldquo;Oxios Hibernate&amp;rdquo; app as well on public demand.

Everyone wants to do something new and extra-ordinary. People like me (read software engineers) want to develop &amp;ldquo;something&amp;rdquo; cool. BUT, the stage where most of them go wrong is the very first one. Most of them think that the road to develop something cool starts from a particular &amp;ldquo;language&amp;rdquo; or a tool. But I beg to differ. I say the first stage is &amp;ldquo;The Idea&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most of my friends and others around me think that having a particular skill set is very important to develop something the world hasn&amp;rsquo;t seen till now. And for this they end up reading through piles of books, which claim to make them a master in C, C++, PHP, Python, Web 2.0 and what not. This is all OK, but the problem is, when they have gone through the books, done all the exercises, made all the samle projects, then they have a question in their minds &amp;ldquo;Now What&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What I think is that this question should have been asked in the very beginning of the journey. And it should have been answered by the occurrence of a new idea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong. I&amp;rsquo;m all for reading books, developing skill sets, learning new technologies, etc. But the only point I want to make is that all this is a &amp;ldquo;means&amp;rdquo; to give your &amp;ldquo;idea&amp;rdquo; a shape. They are not where your story begins. What if you spent a lot of time acquiring perl skills and then when (and if) you get your brilliant idea, you find out that the best way to implement it would be using C. Are you back to square one? No. Skills acquired are never a waste. &amp;ldquo;Concepts&amp;rdquo; developed can easily be applied to the new tool that you have to use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But one more thing, its again not a hard rule that now you should just sit in your chair all day long and keep thinking. I bet its much harder to get the idea stream flowing that way. Ideas don&amp;rsquo;t have a pattern that they follow while coming into your mind. They may come to you any place unexpected (I get most of mine while bathing ;-) ).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But there is something you can do to ensure that your brain gets accustomed to recognize an idea when you do get it. So, while you are reading through that book on C programming, don&amp;rsquo;t just get engrossed in typing out the exact source code that&amp;rsquo;s fed to you. &amp;ldquo;Think&amp;rdquo; about whether is that enough? Can you make some modification to it so that it becomes more efficient? Can you tweak it a bit to do more than its already doing?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Keep your eyes open when you go around your daily chores. Think when you open your door whether wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice if the door could recognize you are there and open itself. There&amp;rsquo;s your idea. And while you are at it, think wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be even nicer if your home would have poured you a cool drink itself when you enter it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, tell me whether you would like to wait to think about these ideas till you read the book&amp;rsquo;s epilogue, or do you want to start thinking now?&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Project: My WordPress Plugin shantz-wp-qotd updated to version 1.2.2</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/10/project-my-wordpress-plugin-shantz-wp-qotd-updated-to-version-122/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2008 20:33:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/10/project-my-wordpress-plugin-shantz-wp-qotd-updated-to-version-122/</guid><description>&lt;p>Updated my WordPress plugin shantz-wp-qotd to version 1.2.2 today.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>**Problem: **My host supports both PHP4 and PHP5. I decided to migrate &lt;a href="http://blog.shantanugoel.com/">my personal blog&lt;/a> to PHP5 today by adding the aforementioned line to my .htaccess. Immediately, my blog disappeared, and in its place, all that was left was a few errors:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>[07-Apr-2008 12:11:49] PHP Warning: flock() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /…/wp-cache-phase2.php on line 105

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Note: I&amp;rsquo;ve deleted the exact file paths above for security reasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It gave me an idea that it had something to do with wp-cache. When I tried to open the settings for wp-cache, it again gve error that web server doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the permissions to write the file wp-cache-config.php, wp_cache_mutex.lock etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Analysis:&lt;/strong> On checking the file permissions for these mentioned files, I found that they already belong to the user under which the web server runs. So, write permissions shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been a problem. I guessed that maybe this issue is because of another &amp;ldquo;handler&amp;rdquo; (x-httpd-php5) now trying to modify the files while earlier they were created by the php4 handler. But I couldn&amp;rsquo;t change the permissions now because they were created by the web server and I can&amp;rsquo;t modify/delete them through ssh/ftp under my username.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Solution: **So, the solution (or workaround as you may call it) was to login to my cpanel, and use the &amp;ldquo;File Manager&amp;rdquo; there, since all operations done by it would also be carried out by the web-server. So, all I did was:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Went back to PHP4&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Disabled WP-Cache Plugin&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Launched the file manager, deleted the wp-content/wp-cache-config.php and wp-content/cache/wp_cache_mutex.lock. Came out.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Enabled PHP5 in .htaccess&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Enable the WP-Cache Plugin&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>And that&amp;rsquo;s it. My Personal Blog is now running happily over PHP5 goodness :). let me know if you have any comments about this or any other suggestions that are better than this workaround.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note:&lt;/strong> This problem might not be limited to WP-Cache alone. There might be other plugins as well having the same problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Note2: **If you feel uncomfortable deleting any file, then make a copy of it through ssh/ftp (so that it is under your user name), delete the original file, and replace it by the copy you made. Now, you can give this file a permission of &amp;ldquo;777&amp;rdquo; (that is readable, writable, executable by all), so that the web server can also modify it.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Project: shantz-wp-prefix-suffix Updated to 1.0.2</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/07/project-shantz-wp-prefix-suffix-updated-to-102/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2008 03:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/07/project-shantz-wp-prefix-suffix-updated-to-102/</guid><description>&lt;p>Many users reported errors while activating the version 1.0.1 of my WordPress plugin shantz-wp-prefix-suffix.

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>That&amp;rsquo;s it. Save your file and you are done.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>So what does it do? Basically I just added an attribute &amp;ldquo;word-wrap: break-word&amp;rdquo; to the sidebar handling. So, if there is a word that cannot fit in the sidebar width, the word will be broken to continue in the next line and thus the sidebar alignment will remain intact. let me know if you face any issues with this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note&lt;/strong> that this particular word-wrap property is Internet Explorer specific. Firefox (and other browsers) will ignore it, but since the problem with sidebar alignment occurs only with IE, so it will enable IE to display your site properly.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Download pidgin 2.4.1 For Ubuntu Feisty Fawn (amd64/x86_64)</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/04/download-pidgin-241-for-ubuntu-feisty-fawn-amd64x86_64/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2008 17:19:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/04/download-pidgin-241-for-ubuntu-feisty-fawn-amd64x86_64/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/logo.pidgin.png" alt="Logo.pidgin">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>pidgin is everybody&amp;rsquo;s favourite IM client. Lifehacker includes it in its list of top 5 IM clients. Obviously I use it too, but one drawback of being lazy and not switching over to Gutsy Gibbon was that I was stuck with version 2.2.0 for a long time. But recently I began a new journey towards d-bus programming and chose pidgin as my companion. Found out that 2.2.0 has some serious d-bus issues on amd64 that were fixed in 2.4.0. Hence, installed all the dependencies, compiled the latest version today from source and installed it. Just thought of putting it out for my fellow Feisty users who are looking to upgrade as well but don&amp;rsquo;t want to go through the mess of compiling from source.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/logo.pidgin.png" alt="Logo.pidgin">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>So download it from the below given link. However, since it is a relatively big package (around 8.5 MB), I might pull it if the bandwidth usage becomes too much, so download soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can install it by:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Either using &amp;ldquo;gdebi&amp;rdquo; - A nice deb package installer that will also try to resolve dependencies for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>or by running &amp;ldquo;dpkg -i pidgin_2.4.1-1_amd64.deb&amp;rdquo; on command line.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Let me know if you have any issues with it.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Wanted: A Good Paint Program For Linux</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/03/wanted-a-good-paint-program-for-linux/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2008 12:47:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/03/wanted-a-good-paint-program-for-linux/</guid><description>&lt;p>Have been in the hunt for a good basic paint program for linux for so long.

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/1_cant_find_computer.jpg" alt="Cannot Find Computer on Network">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, there is no big magic trick to get an access to those shares, as they are already accessibly. You just need to do one more teeny little step to access them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The trick is that on Windows Mobile it will not detect your computer as having a shareable folder and will not show it, and it will thus not show a list of shared folders. So, what you need to do is enter the path to the folder you want to access. e.g.: If your computer&amp;rsquo;s name is &amp;ldquo;MyComp&amp;rdquo; and the folder you want to access is &amp;ldquo;MyFolder&amp;rdquo;, then you need to give the path &amp;ldquo;\MyComp\MyFolder&amp;rdquo; to the application on Windows Mobile from which you are trying to access your shares and it&amp;rsquo;ll connect without any problems. Of course, it&amp;rsquo;ll ask you for your username/pwd for which you need to enter your linux user name and password. Below screenshots tell you how to do this with Resco Explorer, however the same method can be used for other applications like Total Commander, Windows Mobile File Explorer, etc as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Enter Path and click share.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/2_enter_full_path.jpg" alt="Enter Full Path">&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>Enter User Name / Password&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The issue here is that the code highlighting plugins use the &amp;ldquo;exact&amp;rdquo; text entered within the [ code ] (or similar) tags, and since we used the WYSIWYG/visual editors, they add html formatting tags to the code and also convert some special characters into HTML entities (e.g. &amp;gt; into &amp;gt;, &amp;lt; into &amp;lt;, white space into  , etc).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The workaround is that you can write the code in html editing mode. But the problem here is that if you happen to switch to the visual mode or edit your post in this mode any time later, the problem will come back which makes editing posts a pain. So, here is a simple hack that will let you write your code in visual/WYSIWYG mode without doing anything special.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Note: **Although this hack is for &lt;a href="http://blog.igeek.info/still-fresh/2006/02/25/code-for-fun/">iG:Synatx Highlighter&lt;/a> plugin, but it can be added similarly to other plugins as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step 1) Open the file syntax_hilite.php.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step 2) Go to line no. 191 and delete the following 3 lines:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-php" data-lang="php">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$arrSearch &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">array&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;lt; &amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;amp;lt; &amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34; &amp;gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34; &amp;amp;gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;lt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;amp;lt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Step 3) At the same place (from where you deleted the lines), add the following lines:&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Step 4) Save the file. That&amp;rsquo;s it. You&amp;rsquo;re done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What we just did was strip out all the extraneous html formatting added by your editor and then convert the html entities into the characters that we want.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**IMPORTANT: **After this hack, you should write your code in visual mode. If you want to display some html code to your readers and write it in html mode of the editor then it might go boink. Otherwise it should be simple enough to create a new tag so that one set html editor code works and for another set, visual editor code works. But I would definitely recommend against it and anyways writing all code in visual mode, just like your other parts of your posts as its much more intuitive to write and easier to maintain and port to newer platforms.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Project: Windows Mobile Tool ShantzTodayChanger Updated to version 1.53</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/22/project-windows-mobile-tool-shantztodaychanger-updated-to-version-153/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2008 20:49:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/22/project-windows-mobile-tool-shantztodaychanger-updated-to-version-153/</guid><description>&lt;p>ShantzTodayChanger is a little tool written by me for your Windows Mobile based phones (WM5/WM6) which will cycle ur today background or theme after a set interval of time.

This is what it is, a dirtly little hack, otherwise I&amp;rsquo;d have called it an &amp;ldquo;enhancement&amp;rdquo; &lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/smile1.gif" alt="Smile">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now onto the main things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Aim:&lt;/strong> You would have used wp_list_pages (or plugins like &lt;a href="http://www.dagondesign.com/articles/list-subpages-plugin-for-wordpress/">dd-list-subpages&lt;/a>, that use it) to display a list of your pages/subpages on a particular page. e.g., I use it on my &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://tech.shantanugoel.com/projects">Projects&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; pages hierarchy to list all the relevant projects under a particular heading. Now, the thing is that wp_list_pages gives you a lot of options to display things like dates, page title, page link, etc, but that&amp;rsquo;s not enough. I need to provide a small description for each page as well, to put things into perspective. Obviously, I don&amp;rsquo;t expect the visitors to go inside each link to see what it holds in store for them.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Disclaimer:&lt;/strong> I&amp;rsquo;m neither a WordPress guru nor a PHP expert.

I need to provide a small description for each page as well, to put things into perspective. Obviously, I don&amp;rsquo;t expect the visitors to go inside each link to see what it holds in store for them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Hack:&lt;/strong> What you need to do is locate a file called &amp;ldquo;classes.php&amp;rdquo; in your wordpress installation. It is usually located at &lt;code>&amp;lt;WordPress Base&amp;gt;/wp-includes&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, open the file and find a function called &amp;ldquo;start_el&amp;rdquo;. This is a function in the &amp;ldquo;Walker&amp;rdquo; class, which is used in WordPress to parse tree-like structures. Here, it used by wp_list_pages to list out all the pages. Now, at the very end of this function (just after the closing brace of if ( !empty($show_date) ) { ), place the following piece of code:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-php" data-lang="php">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$description &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">get_post_meta&lt;/span>($page&lt;span style="color:#f92672">-&amp;gt;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">ID&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;description&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">true&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">if&lt;/span> ($page&lt;span style="color:#f92672">-&amp;gt;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">ID&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">!=&lt;/span> $current_page)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> $output &lt;span style="color:#f92672">.=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/br&amp;gt; &amp;#34;&lt;/span>;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">if&lt;/span> (&lt;span style="color:#f92672">!&lt;/span>$description)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> $description &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">strip_tags&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">substr&lt;/span>($page&lt;span style="color:#f92672">-&amp;gt;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">post_content&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">0&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">250&lt;/span>));
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> $output &lt;span style="color:#f92672">.=&lt;/span> $description;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>What this code does is:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Look for a custom field called &amp;ldquo;description&amp;rdquo; in your pages. If present, it will show what you wrote there after each of your page in the list generated by wp_list_pages. (To add a custom field to your page, look at the very bottom of your &amp;ldquo;write&amp;rdquo; page or &amp;ldquo;manage&amp;rdquo; page in the WordPress dashboard.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If the &amp;ldquo;description&amp;rdquo; field is not present (obviously you might not like to go back and add a custom field to all your pages), it takes the first 250 characters of your page&amp;rsquo;s content and displays that.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Hack Is Not Finished Yet:&lt;/strong> There is just one little thing left to do. As I mentioned, this function is used other times as well (e.g. making your navigation menu). So, you don&amp;rsquo;t want the description to be appearing always, otherwise it will wreak havoc on your site&amp;rsquo;s layout. So, there is again a dirty little trick to prevent this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the place where you are calling wp_list_pages, modify the call to include the following code before and after the call:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-php" data-lang="php">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">update_option&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;my_wp_list_pages_option&amp;#39;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">1&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$content &lt;span style="color:#f92672">.=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">wp_list_pages&lt;/span>($your_wp_list_pages_options);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">update_option&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;my_wp_list_pages_option&amp;#39;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">0&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>And, modify the previously listed code as well to look like:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-php" data-lang="php">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$my_wp_list_pages_option &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">get_option&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;my_wp_list_pages_option&amp;#39;&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">if&lt;/span> ($my_wp_list_pages_option &lt;span style="color:#f92672">==&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">1&lt;/span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> $description &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">get_post_meta&lt;/span>($page&lt;span style="color:#f92672">-&amp;gt;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">ID&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;description&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">true&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">if&lt;/span> ($page&lt;span style="color:#f92672">-&amp;gt;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">ID&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">!=&lt;/span> $current_page)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> $output &lt;span style="color:#f92672">.=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/br&amp;gt; &amp;#34;&lt;/span>;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">if&lt;/span> (&lt;span style="color:#f92672">!&lt;/span>$description)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> $description &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">strip_tags&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">substr&lt;/span>($page&lt;span style="color:#f92672">-&amp;gt;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">post_content&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">0&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">250&lt;/span>));
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> $output &lt;span style="color:#f92672">.=&lt;/span> $description;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>What this does now is that it adds an option/variable to WordPress database, which you set to 1 before calling wp_list_pages to tell your code that now its time to display the description, and then restore its state to 0, to prevent the description from being displayed for any other wp_list_pages call.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For your reference, I&amp;rsquo;m attaching my copy of classes.php here.&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://tech.shantanugoel.com/uploads/classes.php.zip">File Attachment: classes.php.zip (6 KB)&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For an example of how it finally looks like, take a look at my &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://tech.shantanugoel.com/projects">Project&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; page.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I’m sure you have copied/moved files on your computer from one place to another. And I’m sure often you have to do more than just “single-shot” copying that is copy a few files to one place, move a few to another, and copy yet some more to one more location.

Hence, I wrote this little command line program, which behaves like a basket.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can put any number of files from any number of different locations into it in a single shot. It will store their locations and give them an ID. Now, you can copy/move those files to differnet destinations based on their IDs. What&amp;rsquo;s even better is that your basket will remain intact even across reboots. So, you can continue working on the files in the basket even for days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Requirements:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The program is multi-platform compatible as I wrote it in Perl and took care of using portable methods only. So, if you have perl installed, you can just download the above perl file and install “File-Copy-Recursive” Module (rest are most probably installed already) and you are good to go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For people who don’t have perl, I’ve uploaded the stand-alone packages for windows as well as linux users. Download according to your platform and you can use them straight away without any hassles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the record, I tested this script as well as the executables on Windows XP SP2 and Ubuntu Feisty Fawn 7.04.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Usage:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Donning the detective cap, if you do a whois for all those domains, they will undoubtedly be registered with Network Solutions. And you are now in there clutches, to buy it for their exhorbitant prices, almost 4-5 times the normal prices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Actually, its not that bad as of now, because NetSol doesn&amp;rsquo;t really &amp;ldquo;buy&amp;rdquo; all those domain names (otherwise it&amp;rsquo;ll take less than a day for them to go bankrupt). They register it with ICANN but are allowed to cancel it within 5 days so they don&amp;rsquo;t have to pay any money. This clause was made to protect registrars from Credit Card fraud, but NetSol is using it to create their own fraud. As now, they can block the site for 5 days for free and people panic and buy it from them for their higher prices. They say that they do it to &amp;ldquo;protect&amp;rdquo; their customers. Hell, all they are protecting is the customers from buying it from their &amp;ldquo;cheaper&amp;rdquo; competitors as NetSol will sell it to anyone who pays and not just the guy who searched for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, if you have become a victim of this and can wait for 5 days, then do that instead of paying through your nose. I call for a boycott of all services of Network Solutions and not just the domain whois, so that they can learn a lesson.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Chinese LionKing800 cellphone claims 1-year standby</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/13/chinese-lionking800-cellphone-claims-1-year-standby/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2008 17:30:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/13/chinese-lionking800-cellphone-claims-1-year-standby/</guid><description>&lt;p>Even though they are using a battery with 10 times the juice of a normal one, but still the claim is impressive on 2 counts acc to me:&lt;/p>

Contacting canon support in India (support, in India? Is that a joke?) resulted in just their ignorance about any such advisory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Undeterred, I sent the camera to the land of dreams (USA) with a friend, e-mailed the Canon USA support at &lt;a href="mailto:carecenter@cits.canon.com">carecenter@cits.canon.com&lt;/a> with my predicament, and they promptly sent shipping labels to my friend. So far so good. But a couple of months went by, with no word from them. Customer support told me they are awaiting parts. Sad I was that day &lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/smile9.gif" alt="">.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One fine day, I just checked the status of the return shipping label on a whim, and found that they had shipped my camera back. I was disheartened thinking it had been returned unrepaired, but then my friend called to let me know that they had sent some other camera back. I thought they might have sent some low price, refurbished camera, but atleast a working camera is better than a non-working one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today my friend came back from the US, and what do we have? A brand spanking new &lt;a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0705/07050703canons5is.asp">Canon Powershot S5 IS &lt;/a>(8 MP, 12x Optical zoom, flip out and twist LCD).

Here is a pic of my new baby (Ah, the irony, the clicking powerhouse has been clicked with a low-res phone camera, but anyways.)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Rahul (my friend and guest author on this blog) introduced me to an old-but-useful trick a few days ago that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about. It&amp;rsquo;s about customizing nautilus to display a context menu that has a few of your chosen scripts to weave their magic on the selected object. And the procedure to do this is summarized in just two steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Write your script.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Save it in ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts and make it executable&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Of course, if you don&amp;rsquo;t know scripting the first step itself is quite daunting, but you can get a lot of pre-cooked scripts on the internet by searching for &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=nautilus+scripts&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search">nautilus scripts&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;. e.g. take a look at &lt;a href="http://g-scripts.sourceforge.net/">g-scripts homepage&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To get you started immediately, here is a crude example to open a terminal/console window in any folder/path through right-click menu:&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Step 1) Write your script (any scripting language: shell, perl, python, etc):&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">#!/bin/bash
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">&lt;/span>gnome-terminal --working-directory&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&lt;/span>$1&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Step 2) Save it in ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts, name it as &amp;ldquo;Terminal&amp;rdquo; and make it executable.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>chmod +x Terminal
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Step 3) Now, you should see a &amp;ldquo;Scripts&amp;rdquo; option in your right-click menu as shown below. Clicking on &amp;ldquo;Terminal&amp;rdquo; will open a new terminal window with the present working directory being set to the selected folder.
&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/nautilus_scripts.png">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/nautilus_scripts_thumb.jpg" alt="Nautilus_scripts">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note:&lt;/strong> If you don&amp;rsquo;t see the &amp;ldquo;scripts&amp;rdquo; menu option (or your script name in the extended menu), then just run&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo killall nautilus
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Let me know if you face any problems with this or have any other questions.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Ubuntu TIP: Automating Package Installation – apt-get to the rescue</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/06/ubuntu-tip-automating-package-installation--apt-get-to-the-rescue/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2008 03:30:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/06/ubuntu-tip-automating-package-installation--apt-get-to-the-rescue/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Admin Note:&lt;/strong> Rahul is a long time friend of mine, and is a well known geek amongst his friends and colleagues.

&lt;p>To get started, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to type the package information in a configuration file. The format of the file is really simple&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Any line starting with a # is ignored&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Blank lines are ignored&lt;/p>

Using tar, making up the script file is enough command line for me. Isn&amp;rsquo;t there an easy way? &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crontab">Cron&lt;/a> is a tool that can schedule any kind of tasks for you, and here we are using it to run our backup script automatically, so that we can concentrate on blogging.

But the basic concept remains the same and with a bit of common sense, you can apply this concept to your site easily.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step1) Look for some option in your control panel, which says something on the lines of &amp;ldquo;cron&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;cron job&amp;rdquo; or such. e.g.:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/automating_website_backups_cpanel1_small.jpg" alt="Automating website backups cpanel1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step2) If you get a screen as shown below, choose the experience level as &amp;ldquo;Standard&amp;rdquo; (maybe &amp;ldquo;novice&amp;rdquo; or similar in your panel). After all, we are using it because we want to avoid that unixy-command-line-stuff &lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/smile3.gif" alt="Smile">.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/automating_website_backups_cpanel2_cron.png">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/automating_website_backups_cpanel2_cron_small.jpg" alt="Automating_website_backups_cpanel2_cron">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step3) You will get a screen as shown below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/automating_website_backups_cpanel3_cron.png">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/automating_website_backups_cpanel3_cron_small.jpg" alt="Automating_website_backups_cpanel3_cron">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, fill in the e-mail ID to which you want the script output to be sent to. (e.g. tar will output the list of files that were backed up) (e.g. &lt;a href="mailto:myemail@mysite.com">myemail@mysite.com&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, give the &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>full&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo; path (yes, starting from the root &amp;ldquo;/&amp;rdquo;) to your script that has to be run (e.g. /home/myusername/backup/backup.sh)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, choose the periodicity/time when this script has to be run, e.g., here we have chosen the script to be run everyday at 10:00 PM. &lt;strong>IMPORTANT:&lt;/strong> Note that the time given here is GMT, so add your timezone offset. Generally, you should select a time when you expect the load on your website to be the lowest. e.g. I have selected a time of 3:00 AM everyday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Press &amp;ldquo;save&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;done&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;add&amp;rdquo; or whatever similar button you can find and it&amp;rsquo;s over &lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/smile1.gif" alt="Smile">. That was easy innit?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s it for today. Lemme know if you have any doubts, or if you would like to see any other questions answered in this series. The question that will be answered next time (in &amp;ldquo;hopefully&amp;rdquo; the last part of the series) is:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q3:&lt;/strong> Well, backup is all hunky-dory. Now, how do I restore?&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Games: Wormux Reporting to Action, SIR!!!</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/03/games-wormux-reporting-to-action-sir/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2008 03:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/03/games-wormux-reporting-to-action-sir/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

With &lt;a href="http://www.wormux.org/">Wormux&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the words of its developers:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Wormux is pre-eminently a &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>convivial mass murder&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo; game where, turn by turn, each member of each team attempts to produce a maximum of damage to his opponents.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/worms1.png">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/worms1_thumb.jpg" alt="Wormux 1">&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/worms2.png">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/worms2_thumb.jpg" alt="Wormux 2">&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/worms3.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/worms3_thumb.jpg" alt="Wormux 3">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But whats a murder strategy game without a big arsenal of close and long range weapons at your disposal. So, you get baseball bats, guns, bazookas, dynamite, grenades, mines, bouncing balls (and you can make your own, if you can code). Gameplay, sticking to the original theme, is turn based. You have to kill your opponent before he kills you. And the innovation to achieve that is limited only by the limits imposed by your mind.

&lt;p>I’m going on a week’s vacation with no net connection, hence this sprang to my mind. What if I can “&lt;strong>call&lt;/strong>” my blog? If I can install a VOIP gateway kind of thing on my web server (or maybe use a third party one, like skype?) and give it access to my database. Now, I can just call my blog’s number from any phone in the world and the possibilities are now endless. e.g.:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I could moderate comments through a voice mail like system, the blog can read out the comments to me, using text-to-speech, and I can press buttons, or use IVR to moderate them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I could even call in and “dictate” posts to my blog that can be published. Thus we will be saved from writing a lot of future posts before going on vacations (like I’m doing right now &lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/smile9.gif" alt=""> )&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Can you think of any more uses of this? Or can you think of any other innovative ideas for improving WordPress, or blogging in general? If yes, then let me know. Lets see what ideas those great minds out there can spin out..&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>WordPress Must Have Plugins: Download Managers</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/29/wordpress-must-have-plugins-download-managers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Feb 2008 04:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/29/wordpress-must-have-plugins-download-managers/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you serve any kind of files for download on your WordPress blog(s), one thing you should definitly be looking out for is a download manager plugin.

&lt;p>Well, if you agree with me, then i would like to tell you about two fantastic plugins:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://urbangiraffe.com/plugins/drain-hole/">Drain Hole&lt;/a>:&lt;/strong> This is a real time saver. Some of the features are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Automatic scanning of directories to generate downloadable files.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Simple interface to upload files&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Categorized downloads&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>SEO urls (no more of those weird links)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Automatic hotlink protection&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Simple integration with SVN repositories&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Can maintain versions of the files (cool !!)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Download urls can be different from their actual path in your server&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Can even pick files from directories residing out of your www or public_html directory.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Superior download security by assigning permissions based on WordPress user roles.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Template tags allow you to insert any particular file(s) or list of all files or files in particular folder on any post, page, sidebar widget&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Statistics - no. of downloads, IP addresses, referrers, etc&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Can force files like php, html, txt etc to be downloaded rather than displaying in browser&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Pretty, can attach icons to files for displaying, different templates can be used for displaying files&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>and…..AJAX &lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/smile1.gif" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>phew, lemme catch my breath here…you can download it from &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/drain-hole/">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://software.y-zone.net/?page_id=3">WP-Vault&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>: This is the second best plugin I could find in this category. It is not as feature rich as Drain Hole, e.g., it misses SEO URls, hotlink protection, svn integration, versioning, etc, but it does have its own set of interesting features:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>get files from FTP/HTTP directly without downloading to computer first. (a real time saver)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Image galleries from stored images.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Supports WordPress&amp;rsquo; caching mechanism to reduce load on database.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>You can take your own pick out of the two. And yeah, this blog uses Drain Hole, if you must ask.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>One Month Completed....</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/28/one-month-completed/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Feb 2008 04:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/28/one-month-completed/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/trophy_small.jpg" alt="tech.shantanugoel.com completes one month">&lt;/p>

Well, this is a short note further developing on the approaches discussed there. Basically, telling tar to backup only those files which have changed. For this, Linux has a command “find” which I am very fond of. You can give it a option “-newer” followed by a f”&lt;em>filename&lt;/em>” and it will return the names of the files that are newer than &lt;em>filename&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://tech.shantanugoel.com/2008/02/25/tip-automating-website-backups-part-ii-reducing-backup-size.html">Last time&lt;/a>, I had told you about how to reduce the backup size.

You can give it a option “-newer” followed by a f”&lt;em>filename&lt;/em>” and it will return the names of the files that are newer than &lt;em>filename&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>find ~ -type f -newer ~/backups/backup_x.tgz &amp;gt; files.txt
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>So, the command given above will find all the files that have changed since you took the backup “&lt;em>backup_x.tgz&lt;/em>” and store those filenames and paths into “_files.txt”. _The “-type f” option makes sure that only filenames are listed and not directory names, because tar creates a lot of issues when presented with directory names (Explore yourself about this).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, all we have to do is give this “&lt;em>files.txt&lt;/em>” to tar as an input to tell it which files to archive.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>tar cvzpGf ~/backups/backup_$date.tgz -T files.txt
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The “-T files.txt” option makes this happen. Moreover, I have introduced 2 new options here, that were not present in our last part. They are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>p – Tells tar to preserve file permissions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>G – Tells tar to ignore any file read errors etc and continue&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Apart from this, you can also take a look at the “-mtime x” option for find command which lets you specify to list files which have changed in past x days. There are other similar options available for find. Look at “man find” and take your pick. Similar options exist for tar, but I have had a lot of weird issues using them, so I’d recommend sticking with this two step process of “find” followed by “tar”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, the above mentioned commands and options can be used in innumerous ways and combinations to achieve your perfect balance of space and ease of use etc for backups. I’ll list down a sample script here, that will make a full backup on every first day of the week, and then make incremental backups over each day for rest 6 days. So, you’ll save a lot of space (more than 5 times), but you will have to use all 7 backup files to make a full restore. (I’m listing just the backup part, you can add the “mutt” command yourself, for e-mailing as mentioned in &lt;a href="http://tech.shantanugoel.com/2008/02/17/tip-automating-website-backups.html">Part I&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>

&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>So?? Did you know that WordPress can import from WordPress?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, WordPress gives you way to &amp;ldquo;export&amp;rdquo; your blog into an XML file that they call as &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Panels#Import">WordPress eXtended RSS&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; (or WXR in short). And then, you can just wipe out everything (or go to your new server), install WP afresh and just import this file into it. A no frills, easy way to make your blog lean again, without losing out on any content.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I’m still puzzled, after reading and rereading HTC’s (pretty short) statement 10 times over and I can’t find where it is mentioned that they will provide video acceleration for the current devices. My point is that if you don’t read it yourself, then better not release it to your readers, (or atleast refrain from commenting on it improperly, if you must be ahead in the “race”).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Read the statement below (and for actual post on Gizmodo, click &lt;a href="http://gizmodo.com/360514/htc-says-software-fix-is-coming-for-lousy-video-drivers">here&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Some of our top engineers have investigated video performance on our devices and have discovered a fix that they claim will dramatically improve performance for common on-screen tasks like scrolling and the like. Their fix would help most of our recent touch-screen products including the Touch family of devices and TYTN II / Tilt, Mogul / XV6900. The update is in testing and we hope to release it soon. However this fix is not a new video driver to utilize hardware acceleration; it is a software optimization. Video drivers are a much more complicated issue that involves companies and engineers beyond HTC alone. We do not want to lead anyone to believe they should expect these. To explain why we are not releasing video acceleration instead of the optimization I offer you our official statement&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;HTC DOES plan to offer software upgrades that will increase feature functionality, over the air wireless speeds and other enhancements for some of the phones being criticized, but we do not anticipate including any additional support for the video acceleration issues cited in customer complaints. It is important for customers to understand that bringing this functionality to market is not a trivial driver update and requires extensive software development and time. HTC will utilize hardware video acceleration like the ATI Imageon in many upcoming products. Our users have made it clear that they expect our products to offer an improved visual experience, and we have included this feedback into planning and development of future products. To address lingering questions about HTC&amp;rsquo;s current MSM 7xxx devices, it is important to establish that a chipset like an MSM7xxx is a platform with a vast multitude of features that enable a wide range of devices with varied functionality. It is common that devices built on platforms like Qualcomm&amp;rsquo;s will not enable every feature or function. In addition to making sure the required hardware is present, unlocking extended capabilities of chipsets like the MSM 7xxx requires in-depth and time consuming software development, complicated licensing negotiations, potential intellectual property negotiations, added licensing fees, and in the case of devices that are sold through operators, the desire of the operator to include the additional functionality. To make an informed decision about which handset suits them best, consumers should look at the product specification itself instead of using the underlying chipset specifications to define what the product could potentially become.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The video drivers for HTC Wizard are now out. They are in beta stage but are working fine for me. You can find them &lt;a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=364066">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Matt and his AutoMattic team took care of bonded labour like us, and had the good heart to put in the capability of scheduling posts in WordPress (More commonly known as “&lt;em>future posting&lt;/em>”).

&lt;p>Well, being honest, you will have to do just a tad little bit more than that, but it’ll be a teeny weeny bit only, I promise. Read on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are using the WordPress web interface to make your posts (are you still living in the darkages? Didn’t you hear about BlogJet, Live Writer, Zoundry?), then all you have to do is that when you make your post, before pressing the publish button, look towards your lower left hand corner (No man, I mean the lower left corner of “the screen”, not your table). You will see something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/wordpress_future_post_time1.png" alt="Wordpress_future_post_time1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, all you gotta do is, check that little checkbox that says “Edit Timestamp” and then change the date and time to the time when you want to be actually published. Click “Publish”, and then….well, that’s it. You are done. It will look something like this (the post will be published on Feb 26, 9:30 AM):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/wordpress_future_post_time2.png" alt="Wordpress_future_post_time2">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, you are indeed keeping up with the modern times, you say, and are using cool desktop client tools, e.g. ,I use BlogJet (and that too over linux, read &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/2008/01/29/blogjet-blog-faster-blog-better-now-in-linux-too-with-a-hidden-bonus.html">this&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> for more). So what can we do about that. Its pretty simple really, almost the same thing. Again, look in the lower left corner, and you see:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/blogjet_future_post_time1.png" alt="Blogjet_future_post_time1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Obviously, you are intelligent enough to modify it to look like this before pressing the lovely, earthy publish button:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/blogjet_future_post_time2.png" alt="Blogjet_future_post_time2">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All set? No, there is one little difference in this method. When you are posting through a desktop client, the post time seem to be interpreted in GMT in WordPress, so you have to discount for that. e.g., as an example if my time zone is +6:00 wrt GMT, I have put in the time as 3:30 AM in BlogJet to achieve the same publish time (Feb 26, 09:30 AM local time).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hope this was easy enough for you. If it was, then don’t forget to spend the extra time on weekdays buying groceries and taking some burden off your wife/mom/etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**PS: **This post was future-posted as well, and through BlogJet, if you must ask.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>HollowMan Redux: Google Presents Gmail Users the Invisibility Cloak</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/25/hollowman-redux-google-presents-gmail-users-the-invisibility-cloak/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Feb 2008 18:53:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/25/hollowman-redux-google-presents-gmail-users-the-invisibility-cloak/</guid><description>&lt;p>Google gave us a nice little present today.

So, thought of doing a few follow ups to that post. This is done in more of a FAQ fashion, so as to answer some of the questions that may arise after reading the first post. Each post will answer one of the questions listed below in detail&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Questions to be answered:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q1:&lt;/strong> I have strict limits on webspace/email attachment etc. Can anything be done to reduce the backup size?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Q2: **Cron? Using tar, making up the script file is enough command line for me. Isn’t there an easy way?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q3:&lt;/strong> Well, backup is all hunky-dory. Now, how do I restore?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Want the answers? Read on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q1:&lt;/strong> I have strict limits on webspace/email attachment etc. Can anything be done to reduce the backup size?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**A1: **Sure, we can do quite a lot about it. If your concern is just the webspace, and you want a very simple restoring process, you should be looking for reducing the number of backups that you save on the server, instead of reducing the size of the backup (you anyways have all the backups mailed out to you). The number of backups can be reduced by manipulating the command given in step 1 of the previous post. To recall, the command was:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>tar cvzf ~/backups/backup_&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">`&lt;/span>date +%w&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">`&lt;/span>.tgz ~/public_html
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Here, the &lt;code>date +%w&lt;/code> part ensured that at any time there will be 7 previous backups at max stored on the server (backup_0.tgz, backup_1.tgz,…). You can remove this part and every day your previous backup will be overwritten by the new one, thus using space for just 1 backup. And since you have all the backups emailed to you as well, you don’t need to worry about restoring back to any point in time. Its just that having the backup on your server saves some time if you do have to restore since you don’t have to upload the backup file onto the server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>BUT&lt;/strong>, if you must place restriction on your backup size (backup is so big that that your email can’t handle it as an attachment or you are really really pressed for webspace or backing up all the files takes up too much time/cpu of the host server), then you can save yourself by backing up only the files that need to be backed up. What does that mean? All CMS (Content Management Systems like Joomla, WordPress, Drupal, or your custom ones, or even a manually made site) will have some/many static components/files which don’t change with time, and so these files don’t need to be backed up every time. You can just backup the files that change or the ones that get added (like images, uploads etc).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, all you have to do is determine which files you &lt;strong>don’t&lt;/strong> want backed up, create a list for them and supply it to the _tar _command, with the _—exclude-from _option, and tar will dutifully avoid zipping those files up, leaving you with only the most needed files.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>tar cvzf ~/backups/backup_&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">`&lt;/span>date +%w&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">`&lt;/span>.tgz ~/public_html —exclude-from&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>exclude_these_files.txt
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now, there are two ways to go about determining which files you don’t need. First is that you simply run “&lt;em>ls -R &amp;gt; exclude_these_files.txt”&lt;/em> on the root of your home directory on the server (the folder beneath which your &lt;em>public_html&lt;/em> or &lt;em>www&lt;/em> folder resides). Then fire up your favourite editor and load this file into that and delete the file names from the file which you want to back up, leaving only those filenames in the file which you don’t want to backup. Generally, you would be interested in backing up any files that you have uploaded yourself onto the server (like images, archives, songs, any other files that you uploaded, any files that you modified, etc)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are not sure which files you should be backing up and you don’t want to backup all files, then there is still hope for you, but only if you are reading this guide before starting a new site &lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/smile3.gif" alt="">. Because then, before making any posts or customizations, you can just run the above mentioned &lt;em>ls&lt;/em> command, and you will have a list of the default files that are always there with your CMS and you don’t need to back them up. However, make sure that if you ever change any of the default files, do delete their names from the exclude_these_files.txt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s it for today. Lemme know if you have any doubts, or if you would like to see any other questions answered in this series. The question that will be answered next time is:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Q2: **Cron? Using tar, making up the script file is enough command line for me. Isn’t there an easy way?&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Project: shantz-wp-qotd Updated and shantz-wp-prefix-suffix released</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/24/project-shantz-wp-qotd-updated-and-shantz-wp-prefix-suffix-released/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Feb 2008 09:44:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/24/project-shantz-wp-qotd-updated-and-shantz-wp-prefix-suffix-released/</guid><description>&lt;p>I updated my wordpress plugin shantz-wp-qotd.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>== Description ==&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shantz WP Prefix Suffix is a light-weight and easy to use plugin which allows you to add any text and/or HTML/CSS code to your posts and/or pages as prefix (top / beginning), middle and/or suffix (bottom /end). (That includes even any new or old posts and pages and even your feed)
Examples of use cases could be to include your copyright message, advertisements (like adsense, etc), permalinks, your other site links, any other custom messages. This works very fine with ads as you don&amp;rsquo;t have to manipulate your posts or templates to add the ad code, shantz-wp-prefix-suffix will do that for you automatically for all posts and you also get basic controls whether to &amp;ldquo;display&amp;rdquo; the ad or not (on home pages, excerpts, etc).&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>Shantz WP Prefix Suffix&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The shantz-wp-prefix-suffix plugin can be installed in following easy steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Unzip &amp;ldquo;shantz-wp-prefix-suffix&amp;rdquo; archive and put all files into your &amp;ldquo;plugins&amp;rdquo; folder (/wp-content/plugins/). It is advisable to create a sub directory into the plugins folder, like /wp-content/plugins/shantz-wp-prefix-suffix/&lt;/p>

&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>== Frequently Asked Questions ==&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>= How do I add My copyright message and post permalink so as to protect myself against RSS feed scrapers =
Add the following code to &amp;ldquo;Suffix text box&amp;rdquo; and check the &amp;ldquo;enable php input&amp;rdquo; option (without the &amp;ldquo;pre&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;code&amp;rdquo; tags. I put them there for the wordpress readme parser):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>= How do I use this for Adsense =
You can either paste your javascript code in the text box and ads will appear automatically in your posts. If you use an ad management plugin like adsense-manager then you can paste the code given by that plugin in the text box, so that all your posts/pages will be &amp;ldquo;able&amp;rdquo; to display the code but actual display is controlled by your ad management plugin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>= How to upgrade to a new version =
Use the automatic upgrade option in WordPress or simply overwrite the old files with the new ones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>= How can I contribute to keep the development of this plugin going =
You could add a link to my blog from your site or click on the donate link on the settings screen :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>= My question isn&amp;rsquo;t listed here =
Post a comment here, or contact me through the contact page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>== Screenshots ==&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can see the plugin in action on this site on any post (The links at top of each post, the adsense ads in the middle of the posts and the copyright notice and feed subscription links at the bottom)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is a (proof-of-concept) outlook macro that you can use with an outlook rule to retrieve your files from your home/office PC by sending it a mail with a subject having a predefined special keyword and the body containing the names and paths of the files. The remote PC will then mail you the files on a predefined e-mail ID.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This project came into being after reading &lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/357710/retrieve-any-file-on-your-home-computer-by-email">this post&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> at lifehacker (original post and solution &lt;a href="http://murphymac.com/retrieve-a-remote-file-by-email/">here&lt;/a>).

Seeing that people wanted it for windows as well, I thought of making something up during lunch time at office.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Introduction:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project came into being after reading &lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/357710/retrieve-any-file-on-your-home-computer-by-email">this post&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> at lifehacker (original post and solution &lt;a href="http://murphymac.com/retrieve-a-remote-file-by-email/">here&lt;/a>). It listed a method to retrieve mails on your home/office PC by sending a &amp;ldquo;magic email&amp;rdquo; to it, but it was only for mac&amp;rsquo;s. Seeing that people wanted it for windows as well, I thought of making something up during lunch time at office.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Usage:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Download the attached zip file (shantz-outlook-remote-file-access.zip) and unzip it. It has a VB module &amp;ldquo;shantz-outlook-remote-file-access.bas&amp;rdquo; (can be opened with any text editor)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Create a new macro in Outlook. Copy the code contained in Module1.bas to the main source file of the macro.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Edit the code to change the e-mail ID to which the files will be e-mailed. Save the macro.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Create a new rule in Outlook. Choose to run the rule when a specific word is found in the subject. e.g. use &amp;ldquo;SendMeMyFiles&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The action part of the rule should be &amp;ldquo;run a script&amp;rdquo;. Here you can choose the macro that you just created from the list shown by Outlook.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Save the rule and you are done.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Now try, sending a mail to the account that your outlook is configured to receive mail for, with the special keyword in the subject and a list of files (with their complete absolute paths on the remote computer) separated by semicolons (&amp;quot;;&amp;quot; without the quotes), and watch magic happen :).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>e.g.: To: &lt;a href="mailto:myemail@email.com">myemail@email.com&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>subject: SendMeMyFiles&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Body: c:\path\of\files\file1;d:\second\path\file2&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>IMPORTANT NOTES:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>For this thing to work, outlook has to be running on the remote PC as this depends on a &amp;ldquo;client-side&amp;rdquo; rule.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>This is just a proof-of-concept as of now, so there is no error handling right now. Plus the e-mail body parsing is finicky and so the e-mail body should not have anything other than the file paths and names. This might change in future if I decide to update it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t use it if your life depends on it. Use it for basic purposes and modify and improve it appropriately before you decide to use it seriously (You may submit your modifications here as well)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It has been tested only on Outlook 2003, but might work on others as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Let me know of any thoughts you may have about this.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Boring Meetings?

It can get hacked, you may install something wrong, a wrong configuration can wreak havoc, the server hard disk might crash, natural calamities, and what not. Your best option to secure yourself against all this is summarized in just one word “BACKUP”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, a backup involves two most important things: “Database Backup” and “Files Backup”. Most webhosts give you the options to back these up for you but with a few catches:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You can backup but only through your control panel manually. No automation/scheduling of backups.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Automated Backing up is not free&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Automated Backing up is free but restoring is not as they give you the backed up data only on request.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There are many plugins available for most CMS and blogging sw for backing up databases. But what about the files? Especially if you have more than one sites on one hosting account. Well, here I’ll tell you how to automate file backups in three simple steps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note: This guide is only for linux based hosts. But you can follow a similar approach for windows based hosting as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step 1) Backup through command line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can use “tar” for this. With tar, you can create compressed archives quickly for a complete directory tree.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>tar cvzf ~/backups/backup_`date +%w`.tgz ~/public_html
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Explanation:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>tar is the name of the command&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>c =&amp;gt; compress v=&amp;gt; verbose z=&amp;gt;gzip for compression&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;del>/backups =&amp;gt; backup directory where ur backups will be stored (&lt;/del> is shortcut for your home directory). It is generally a good practice to store your backups in a directory not directly accessible through http, i.e., outside your public_html directory.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>backup_&lt;code>date +%w&lt;/code>.tgz =&amp;gt; forms the name of the backup file in the form &lt;code>backup_&amp;lt;dayofweek&amp;gt;.tgz&lt;/code>. This will form a circular buffer kind of scenario where backups more than 1 week later will automatically be overwritten by latest ones to avoid using up all your webspace. You can modify this according to your need and available webspace by taking a look at man page of “date” command. (Run “man date” on command line)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>~/public_html =&amp;gt; is the directory you want to backup. Most probably your website will be located in this directory. If not sure, then check with your webhost.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Step 2) Mailing the backup to yourself through command line. (The server might develop some problem, hard disk might crash or your backups on server might be lost, so this is a good option to have)&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-mysql" data-lang="mysql">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>mutt &lt;span style="color:#f92672">-&lt;/span>s &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;Backup `date`&amp;#34;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">-&lt;/span>a &lt;span style="color:#f92672">~/&lt;/span>backups&lt;span style="color:#f92672">/&lt;/span>backup_&lt;span style="color:#f92672">`&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">date&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">+%&lt;/span>w&lt;span style="color:#f92672">`&lt;/span>.tgz myuserid&lt;span style="color:#f92672">@&lt;/span>mymail.com
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Explanation:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>mutt =&amp;gt; mailing user agent that sends the mail (You can use others, but I prefer mutt)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>-s &amp;ldquo;Backup &lt;code>date&lt;/code>&amp;rdquo; =&amp;gt; -s option is to specify the subject of the mail on command line. This line will specify the backup date as subject.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>-a ~/backups/backup_&lt;code>date +%w&lt;/code>.tgz =&amp;gt; -a option specifies the file to be attached.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="mailto:myuserid@mymail.com">myuserid@mymail.com&lt;/a> =&amp;gt; Specify the mail id t which the email has to be sent&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;/dev/null =&amp;gt; The body of the email is empty. If you want some text to be here, you can form a file, say “email.txt” and write the contents in it and replace the above part with “&amp;lt;email.txt”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Step 3) Final Step. Automating it all. What you need to do is add the above commands into a script and then find a way to make it run automatically.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The script looks like:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">#!/bin/bash
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">&lt;/span> tar cvzf ~/backups/backup_&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">`&lt;/span>date +%w&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">`&lt;/span>.tgz ~/public_html
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> mutt -s &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;Backup `date`&amp;#34;&lt;/span> -a ~/backups/backup_&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">`&lt;/span>date +%w&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">`&lt;/span>.tgz myuserid@mymail.com
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Save it as “backup.sh” and make it executable by running “chmod +x backup.sh”. We’ll assume that you save it in ~/backups directory. You can store it anywhere, just remember it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, you need to tell the server to run it automatically at a specified time. We’ll use “cron” for this. (If you are not comfortable with command line, then login to your website control panel, and look for an option called cron, where you can make the schedule graphically) Run the following command:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>crontab -e
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This will open a file with your scheduled tasks info. Make sure that you don’t touch any of the existing lines. Add the following line at the end.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>MAILTO=&amp;#34;myusername&amp;#34;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>00 22 * * * ~/backups/backup.sh
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The first line will make sure that the output of the script, any errors etc, are sent to the your local mail account, that you can check for debugging purposes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second line is of the format “# m h dom mon dow command”
m=&amp;gt; minute of the hour
h=&amp;raquo; hour of the day
dom=&amp;gt; Day of month
mon=&amp;gt; month of year
dow=&amp;gt; day of week
command=&amp;gt; command that you want to run
So, the command mentioned above will run the command every day at 10:00 PM GMT. You can modify the line according to your needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s it. You are done. Just wait for the specified time, and then check your mailbox for the backup file. Let me know if you face any problems, have any issues, or want to ask any questions about cuztomizing it for yourself.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Engineer: A New Definition</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/14/engineer-a-new-definition/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Feb 2008 17:06:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/14/engineer-a-new-definition/</guid><description>&lt;p>Came across this funny, but still thought provoking, definition of an engineer.&lt;/p>

For me at least, ubuntu (fiesty 7.04 amd64) never seems to recognize that I&amp;rsquo;ve connected the speakers to my Audigy 2 ZS Notebook PCMCIA card, and merrily continues to huff-puff through the tinny laptop speakers until I manually go into the sound preferences, switch over to multichannel playback and vice versa. Well, I still haven&amp;rsquo;t found an automated solution for the switching, but here is a little cli-magic to do this in a click.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>If you have multiple soundcards in your system and have to switch between them regularly (e.g. laptop owners like me, who use an external soundcard while being docked to groove to the highest and the lowest of frequencies through those 7.1 channels and use the in-built sound card while on the move) you would definitely be under-whelmed by the less-than-stellar performance of ubuntu in switching between the sound cards.

Well, I still haven&amp;rsquo;t found an automated solution for the switching, but here is a little cli-magic to do this in a click.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have alsa on ur system, just use the command &amp;ldquo;asoundconf list&amp;rdquo; first to list out all the soundcards connected to your system. e.g. on my system, the output is&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$asoundconf list
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>IXP
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>AUDIGY2
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Here, IXP is my internal sound card and AUDIGY2 is my external (PCMCIA) sound card. Now, all you need to is use &lt;code>asoundconf set-default-card &amp;lt;cardname&amp;gt;&lt;/code> to switch over to any card desired. So, what I did was make 2 bash scripts, and insert this command in them with each having one of my soundcards&amp;rsquo; names.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>script 1 - setixp.sh&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">#!/bin/bash
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">&lt;/span>asoundconf set-default-card IXP
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Similarly, script 2 - setaudigy.sh&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">#!/bin/bash
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">&lt;/span>asoundconf set-default-card AUDIGY2
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now, all that remains is save the two scripts (maybe in ur home directory or ur desktop), and make them executable (use &lt;code>chmod +x &amp;lt;scriptname&amp;gt;&lt;/code>). Now, whenever you want to switch to a card, just double-click on the appropriate script, and watch the sound getting redirected. oops, make that &amp;ldquo;hear&amp;rdquo; the sound :P.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>My First WordPress Plugin: Please Welcome shantz-wp-qotd</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/10/my-first-wordpress-plugin-please-welcome-shantz-wp-qotd/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Feb 2008 11:00:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/10/my-first-wordpress-plugin-please-welcome-shantz-wp-qotd/</guid><description>&lt;p>Motivated by Ronald’s ultimate wordpress plugin tutorial at &lt;a href="http://www.devlounge.net/extras/how-to-write-a-wordpress-plugin">devlounge&lt;/a>, I decided that the best way to learn something is to use it in a live project.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>== Installation ==&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Shantz-WP-QOTD plugin can be installed in following easy steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Unzip &amp;ldquo;shantz-wp-qotd&amp;rdquo; archive and put all files into your &amp;ldquo;plugins&amp;rdquo; folder (/wp-content/plugins/). It is advisable to create a sub directory into the plugins folder, like /wp-content/plugins/shantz-wp-qotd/&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Activate the plugin&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Go to Options &amp;gt; Shantz WP Quotes, adjust your settings and save them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>For adding and configuring widget to sidebar, go to Presentation &amp;gt; Widgets.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>== Frequently Asked Questions ==&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>= How to add quotes anywhere in the posts/pages? =
Use the tag &lt;code>&amp;lt;!-- shantz-wp-qotd {option} --&amp;gt;&lt;/code> anywhere in your post (without the quotes).
Note:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>{option} (including the braces) has to be replaced by the quote pattern that you want: qotd, qottd or r. qotd is quote of the day, qottd is quote of that day and r is random.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The tag has to be added using the code editor and not the visual editor, otherwise it will replace the &amp;lt;, &amp;gt; with their HTML equivalents.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>= How to use the custom separator/multi-line quotes? =
By default, if you leave the custom separator box blank, the plugin uses a newline character as the separator. However, if you have quotes that have multiple lines, you can change this to a tag of your choice, say [quote]. Now, in your quotes file (or quotes pasted in admin panel options) add this tag at the end of each quote and you are done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>= What is the format for saving quotes? =
In text box in admin page, as well as in the file, the quotes have to be saved as one on each line. Each quote is separate by newline.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>= Where is the file with quotes located =&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the get from file option, a file &amp;ldquo;quotes.txt&amp;rdquo; has to be present in the same directory where shantz-wp-qotd.php is residing. A sample quotes.txt has been given with this plugin (with some quotes from southpark, simpsons, matrix and deus ex)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>= I checked the option &amp;ldquo;exclude pages&amp;rdquo; but my pages are still displaying quotes =
Check your WordPress version. This option is effective only for Version 2.1 and above&lt;/p>
&lt;p>= How to upgrade to a new version =
Simply overwrite the old files with the new ones.&lt;/p>

Now, if you host a wordpress blog, you’d be aware of the fact that for wordpress to be able to upload yor files (images, attachements in post etc) to the server, you have to make the upload directory writable by all. Now, this is a BIG security risk. Some people go to the lengths of CHMOD’ding their upload directory for a short while and after upload, restoring the apt file permissions back.

But many a people have a heart-ache configuring the ftp with Blogjet, although it is quite simple really. This is basically due to conflicting and confusing instructions existing on the ‘net. So, here I present to you step by step, simplest instrutions to configure this. Read on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step1) Launch Blogjet. You will be presented with a login screen (shown below). You can create a new account or choose to edit an existing one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/1_blogjet_login_screen.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/1_blogjet_login_screen_thumb.jpg" alt="1_blogjet_login_screen">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step2) Choose “I have a blog” on the next screen. Press next.(You might not get this screen if you are editing an old account. In that case, skip to Step 3)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/2_blogjet_create_blog.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/2_blogjet_create_blog_thumb.jpg" alt="2_blogjet_create_blog">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step3) In the “Edit connection Settings” dialog, click on “Configure Settings Manually”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/3_blogjet_settings.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/3_blogjet_settings_thumb.jpg" alt="3_blogjet_settings">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step4) In the Connection settings dialog, there are two options for wordpress blogs. “Wordpress” and “Wordpress (Direct Upload)”. Choose “Wordpress”. The direct upload feature is for people whose wordpress installations have necessary permissions to create files on the server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/4_blojget_account_settings.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/4_blojget_account_settings_thumb.jpg" alt="4_blojget_account_settings">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step5) Enter the username and password for your blog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/5_blogjet_username.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/5_blogjet_username_thumb.jpg" alt="5_blogjet_username">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step6) Now, you get the FTP Configuration screen. Check out the image below and then read the instructions for filling up various columns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/6_blogjet_config_ftp.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/6_blogjet_config_ftp_thumb.jpg" alt="6_blogjet_config_ftp">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i) Tick the checkbox which says “Use FTP to upload pictures…..”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ii) FTP Server: ftp address for your server. e.g.: &lt;a href="ftp://ftp.mysite.com/">ftp.mysite.com&lt;/a> .If you don’t know this, then you should contact your webhost support staff to know about this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>iii) Port: Generally ftp port is 21. However, if you are not sure, then ask your webhost support staff to get the exact number.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>iv) Remote Folder: This is the folder where you want to upload your stuff but is relative to the path where your ftp connection lands you. You’ll need to make a manual ftp connection to your ftp server first to check this. Check the examples after next step.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>v) Base URL: This is the complete web path, that wordpress (or any user over the web) will use to access the image.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Examples: If your ftp server address is &lt;a href="ftp://ftp.mysite.com/">ftp.mysite.com&lt;/a>, and your wordpress blog address is &lt;a href="http://blog.mysite.com/">http://blog.mysite.com&lt;/a> . Your file directory structure is something like given below:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>/-&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>/public_html -&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>/public_html/wordpress
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>/another_folder
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>When you connect to ftp manuall, you land up at “/”, you make a new folder at /public_html/wordpress/uploads, where you are going to upload your files. And your blog address &lt;a href="http://blog.mysite.com/">http://blog.mysite.com&lt;/a> points at /public_html/wordpress/ when you go to it through your web browser, then your field values will be:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remote Folder: /public_html/wordpress/uploads&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Base URL: &lt;a href="http://blog.mysite.com/uploads">http://blog.mysite.com/uploads&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notes: So, basically what you can do is for remote folder, connect to ftp, “cd” to the folder where you want to upload and do “pwd”, this is your remote folder address. For Base url, find out, where your blog address points to (take help of your webhost support if u need), then find your upload folder’s path relative to it, and add that relative path in front of your blog address.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>vi) Username/password: This is your ftp username and password given to you by your webhost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>vii) Now, click on “Test this configuration”. If everything is ok, then you’ll get a “FTP Configured properly” message as shown below. Then click ok and next.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/7_blogjet_ftp_configured.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/7_blogjet_ftp_configured_thumb.jpg" alt="7_blogjet_ftp_configured">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step7) Click on finish. You are done. &lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/smile1.gif" alt="">. Do let me know if this worked for you or you had any issues.&lt;/p>

All this through simple steps like -“&lt;strong>Click, drag, drop&lt;/strong>” and you are set. The other widgets will automatically move up and down to make space.

&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t know this problem existed as I don&amp;rsquo;t use IE but when a friend mailed to let me know, I started hunting around for the solution.

Because this blog was also using the same version.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>The awesome &lt;a href="http://www.mangoorange.com/resources/i3theme/">i3theme&lt;/a> that this blog uses is a treat to the eyes, except to a lot of IE6 users. The issue is that for many people viewing wordpress blogs using this theme, the right sidebar doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear on the right, but &lt;strong>below&lt;/strong> the middle column main area.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t know this problem existed as I don&amp;rsquo;t use IE but when a friend mailed to let me know, I started hunting around for the solution. Infact, found on the home page of i3theme, that the author acknowledged this bug and fixed it in v1.5, except the fact, that the fix doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. Because this blog was also using the same version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, not taking anything away from the author, who has done a wonderful job with the theme, I took it upon myself to fix it, and the solution turned out to be really simple.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first thing I noticed was the &amp;ldquo;tag cloud&amp;rdquo;. Since many of my posts are tagged &amp;ldquo;Windows Mobile&amp;rdquo;, this particular tag had become pretty big, so much so that it was being cut off by the left sidebar boundary. But when I viewed the site in IE, it showed the full tag, but the last 2 letters were jutting out of the left sidebar. which caused the middle area to shift towards right ever so slightly, nudging the right sidebar towards the bottom in the process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hmm, this was the reason that many people never see this problem because they may have a particularly balanced blog (or with shorter tags) where one particular tag does not go out of the boundaries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The solution as anyone can guess now is to keep that tag within its range. Now, I call my solution as a hack or a workaround because ideally, we should be able to create a method to make the tag &amp;ldquo;word wrap&amp;rdquo; inside the edges. But since I was unable to get this done, I chose a simpler way. Make the tag small enough so that it fits!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To do this, go to your sidebar.php (in your i3theme folder) and look for the tag cloud widget. You will find a line similar to this:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-php" data-lang="php">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;?&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">php&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">wp_tag_cloud&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;smallest=8&amp;amp;largest=22&amp;amp;unit=pt&amp;amp;number=45&amp;amp;format=flat&amp;amp;orderby=name&amp;amp;order=ASC&amp;#39;&lt;/span>); &lt;span style="color:#75715e">?&amp;gt;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Change the value of &amp;ldquo;largest&amp;rdquo; from 22 to something smaller, say 16. This will ensure that even if a tag becomes very popular, it won&amp;rsquo;t get too big to cause this problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let me know if this worked for you.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Project: ShantzTodayChanger (Windows Mobile Tool To Cycle Themes/Wallpapers Automatically)</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/03/project-shantztodaychanger-windows-mobile-tool-to-cycle-themeswallpapers-automatically/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Feb 2008 19:45:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/03/project-shantztodaychanger-windows-mobile-tool-to-cycle-themeswallpapers-automatically/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/ShantzTodayChanger.jpg" alt="ShantzTodayChanger Config Screenshot">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is a little tool for your Windows Mobile based phones (Compatible with WM5/WM6 but not WM2003) which will cycle ur today background or theme after a set interval of time.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Intro:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a little tool for your Windows Mobile based phones (Compatible with WM5/WM6 but not WM2003) which will cycle ur today background or theme after a set interval of time. It has a lot of features and options that you can discover by reading the text below. And you can even use this options to achieve something other than changing wallpapers as well but that depends on your imagination. ;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**UPDATE: **I&amp;rsquo;ve released the source code of ShantzTodayChanger since I&amp;rsquo;m not getting much time to work on it. You may download the code from the attached zip file above. I’ll still be available for questions, discussions, explanations etc about it if needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You are free to copy, modify and redistribute it. Only thing that I ask of you are that:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You retain all credits for me and my website in the source code, final product, and other material (readme etc) intact.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Also, please provide a linkback to the original home page of shantztodaychanger if you redistribute it through some other site, otherwise I’ll be happy to host your modified versions here.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You also have to release the modified source code in its entirety.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Download:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Usage: **&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Make a folder on ur device (preferably not on storage card.) and extract all the files (mainly ShantzTodayChanger.exe, TdyChangerCfg.exe, gsgetfile.dll (might not be visible to u depending on ur explorer settings) and Readme.htm) to this folder.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>IMP: Do not rename any files.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run the TdyChangerCfg.exe.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Set options through the dialog that opens and press apply button (Pressing the native WM OK button will discard all your changes)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Options:
i)Choose image type (.gif.jpg.png) or theme(.tsk) to be cycled.
ii)If the input files (images or themes) are not in the folder where exes are kept, then you can check the box (underneath the .gif option) and give the &amp;ldquo;FULL and ABSOLUTE&amp;rdquo; path of where the files are kept. You can either input the path thru keyboard or choose it graphically by pressing the button (&amp;hellip;) next to it.
iii)If you want to run a file after every cycle interval, check the corresponding box and provide the &amp;ldquo;FULL and ABSOLUTE&amp;rdquo; path of the file to be run. You can either input the path thru keyboard or choose it graphically by pressing the button (&amp;hellip;) next to it.
iv) If you want some files to be avoided during cycling, put a file mask. The program will look for this mask to appear anywhere in the name of the files and will avoid it if found. (Wildcards are not supported. Choose time option has to be checked for this to work)
v) Choose the period for which mask option has to be used. If you choose a time period and leave mask as empty, then during that time no cycling will be done. If you want to avoid some files all the time, then time period should be chosen to cover all 24 hrs of the day.
vi)enter the desired interval between cycling of images\themes.
vii)If you choose a period for the mask, another check box (Consider mask period for exe also) will be enabled. Checking this box will mean that the specified exe will be run only if an image\theme is changed during that cycle. If you dont check this, then exe will be run after every cycle even if there is no change in the image\theme.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you want to stop the cycling, press &amp;ldquo;STOP Cycling&amp;rdquo; button.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>**Additional Notes: **&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The GUI for configuration has not been optimized for square screen devices, so you need to make some guesswork and use hardware keyboard for input but the changer program itself will run fine.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Doesnt have to be running constantly. So saves resources when not active.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Survives soft resets as well.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Even takes care of the situation if your phone is off when the time to cycle is reached. Will cycle as soon as ur phone comes back on in this situation.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>**Planned Updates: **
i) Suggestions invited. I have a lot of updates in mind but will incorporate those only which are requested by you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Known Issues: **
i) If the mask option is selected, then in a very particular situation, the app will miss a cycle.
This can be taken care of but not in my priority list because this can be fixed only by rewriting the complete cycling code which is quite a bit. So, will fix it if I get some time from my other projects.
ii) If after maknig the configuration, you see the screen flash for a second at the right times, but the backfround doesn&amp;rsquo;t change, then do this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Go to : Settings&amp;hellip;today&amp;hellip;.appearance&lt;/li>
&lt;li>un-check &amp;ldquo;Use this picture as background&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>start the program using &amp;ldquo;startTodayChanger.lnk&amp;rdquo; or TdyChangerCfg (Apply button)
(Thnx to CWKJ for reporting this bug and fix, and to eric for reminding me about it)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>**End Note: **
Like every software, this one is also bound to have bugs, please report it asap.
Though ShantzTodayChanger does not run continuously but sometimes some apps that close all processes automatically (like SPB backup) might clash in schedule with ShantzTodayChanger and close it when it starts to run. In such a case (which is quite unlikely), the app might not be able to set a notification for next cycle, so if u face this situation, then run the config again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Version History: **&lt;/p>
&lt;p>1.53 - 23-March-08 -&amp;gt; RECOMMENDED UPDATE

ii) Made a little optimization in the code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>1.51 - 05-Aug-07 -&amp;gt;
i) Fixed a bug which prevented the &amp;ldquo;time period&amp;rdquo; option from working properly.
ii) Fixed a bug where wallpapers might not change if certain particular themes were installed before change cycle happens
iii) Fixed a bug where the time period option was not remembered properly by the GUI.
iv) Added option to allow user to choose whether to run the user specified file (exe\lnk) after every cycle interval only if there was a change in image\theme during that cycle.

&lt;p>Well, you can change that. Plus, all you windows-to-linux converts must also be thinking of how to squeeze in a few more windows into the task bar. A &amp;ldquo;grouping of similar windows&amp;rdquo; option like windows would have been just nice. Well, that can be done too, and without any shell scripting, config file modifying, etc. It&amp;rsquo;s all in the GUI for a change &lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/smile1.gif" alt="">&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>I am pretty sure that all of you must be fed of that one windows taking up the whole task bar in the panel.

&lt;p>All you need to do is:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Right click on the window list area, as shown by the red ellipse mark in the figure and click on &amp;ldquo;preferences&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>

&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>You will get a window as shown below. Now, in the options marked by the black ellipse, you can choose the grouping option for the windows that you open to get more space and a windows like effect.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Click Close and you are done. Now, wasn&amp;rsquo;t that easy. Here is a screenshot of how that window title we saw in the first pic looks after this change.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>As the pic above says, it turned out to be quite elementary in the end. But what is &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rdquo; actually?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Problem:&lt;/strong> Since the beginning of time (read launching of WM6), millions of WM users (ok ok, will not exaggerate from now on) have been facing a very peculiar issue. The issue is that people tell them all the time that they are avoiding those people, and not taking their calls. But as the perplexed WM&amp;rsquo;er flips through his calls log, he can&amp;rsquo;t find any sign of a missed call. Yes, the issue is that many times, the phone will go into a state where the caller will hear the ring go, there will be no sign on your phone of the same, not even a missed call. People all around the world have been after the solution with all their might, suggesting:&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/sherlock_small.jpg" alt="Sherlock">&lt;/p>

People all around the world have been after the solution with all their might, suggesting:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>To change over to Radio Rom x.xx.xx and swear it solved all their issues but we have had equal number of people in both camps (fixed and non-fixed) for every radio rom.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Various kinds of flashing techniques and orders but no concrete solution here either.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Standing on their heads and chanting &amp;ldquo;OM&amp;rdquo; for 10000 years (I&amp;rsquo;m at it again :))&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Anyways, the long and short of it is, they didn&amp;rsquo;t get anywhere. But worry no more, the messiah is here to save you all from social embarrassment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What To Expect:&lt;/strong> This will fix the missing call issue, plus on the phones I tested, the following issues were also fixed:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Signal strength meter remains stuck at whatever the strength was when the phone was booted.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The phone LCD turns on for no reason sometime.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I personally found the signal quality to be better. Previously I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to take/make any calls in my office cubicle but now I can.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A solution so simple, obvious and the fact that you already know it. :)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Disclaimer:&lt;/strong> Though I&amp;rsquo;ve promised you almost everything (except the kitchen sink), and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure that this should work for you (as I&amp;rsquo;ve tested this on three different HTC wizards, running different variations of WM6 ROMS), but still YMMV. (Just to save my skin from a disgruntled user who didn&amp;rsquo;t get it fixed and turned into a blood sucking psychopath, or even worse, a lawsuit-happy Jeff Thomson).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another thing to be noted is that if you use ActiveSync to sync with an exchange server, you&amp;rsquo;d probably not be able to solve your problems. Read on to find about it [Thnx to Alex, vboyz103 for reminding me to put it here]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Reasoning:&lt;/strong> Let me take you through my journey of discovering the solution to the problem. There are a lot of events that happened, many things I saw that led me to the solution:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Once I saw my phone light up for no reason and then after a few seconds I received a call on my landline saying I was not picking up my phone. I then tried calling up my phone again and again, every time I didn&amp;rsquo;t get any notification on my phone &amp;ldquo;except&amp;rdquo; a momentary flash up.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Another day I was tapping away at my keyboard, with my phone nearby. Then suddenly again there was a flash up, no call notification, BUT my speakers started humming, for a long time, i.e., as if in a call and not due to those momentary SDCCH transmissions. This meant that the radio ROM was indeed receiving the call, but somehow it could not notify the OS to tell me. &lt;em>Something was breaking the notification mechanism.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All times this happened, and I came to know, I checked to know what all tasks were running and somehow Active Sync was always there.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I tried killing active sync and then calling. Active Sync would be there again. But if I kill it and dont call, then it won&amp;rsquo;t be there. &lt;em>Hmmm..&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I had heard that switching off and flight mode solves this issue temporarily. I tried it. Flight mode could be switched on but was not able to switch off. That is my phone didn&amp;rsquo;t come back, &lt;strong>until&lt;/strong> I tried killing active sync and voila, phone could be turned on again.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Solution:&lt;/strong> Now, I was pretty sure that it had something to do with Active Sync. Another thing was I never had the missing calls issue, until this december when I switched to a new ROM. Was the new ROM bad? Couldn&amp;rsquo;t be because people had reported issues on earlier ROMs as well which I had used but never faced the problem. Then it suddenly dawned on me in zen-like-fashion. The legendary &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>Fake Server Trick&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;. In all my flashes, it was part of my initial rituals to do (along with the customary sacrificial goat) this but this time I had forgotten to. I immediately did it and when I reached the Active Sync schedule settings it was selected to &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>As Items Arrive&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;. Voila! I did the trick at a time when I was missing calls and immediately saw the results. Called from another phone and I got a ring! Somehow, it was eating up the notifications thinking they are some &amp;ldquo;items&amp;rdquo; meant for it. Since then, I tried it out on two more phones of friends with different WM6 ROMs and they havent seen the problem ever since, plus they got all the other benefits too as listed in &amp;ldquo;What to Expect&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Trick:&lt;/strong> Most of you who came here must be knowing the fake server trick, but if you don&amp;rsquo;t, then here it is:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Turn on your Device&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Go to Start &amp;gt; Programs &amp;gt; Activesync.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tap Menu at the bottom right hand corner of the screen.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tap on Add Server Source.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enter anything in all the boxes. Don&amp;rsquo;t need to go to any advanced options, etc. e.g. you can add &amp;ldquo;fake&amp;rdquo; in all options&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Go back into the Menu, and tap &amp;ldquo;Schedule&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Change both the Peak times and Off-peak times boxes to Manually.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Press the OK button at top-right.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You are done.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note:&lt;/strong> If you face any sync errors after doing this trick, then delete the config you just made for exchange and then try. Basically once you have done the schedule setting, you don&amp;rsquo;t require the exchange config anymore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Epilogue:&lt;/strong> Now, this has been working for me and my friends for the past few days. I deliberately delayed this post to be exactly sure. You are welcome to give me a simple thanks if it works for you. BUT if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t then also please let me know, may be we can debug it together.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>WM6.1 Is Here, Loves HTC Wizard...(Really?)</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/01/31/wm61-is-here-loves-htc-wizardreally/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jan 2008 05:54:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/01/31/wm61-is-here-loves-htc-wizardreally/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/Screen002.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/Screen002_thumb.jpg" alt="Screen002">&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/Screen003.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/Screen003_thumb.jpg" alt="Screen003">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Ask any laptop user about how much he liked to kick some butt in Gears of War and he would cringe and cry with agony even before you are able to say the &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rdquo; of Crysis. But not anymore. For its notebook consumers, Dell has finally come up with the &lt;a href="http://direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2008/01/29/43163.aspx">perfect answer&lt;/a> to the questions posed by these ridiculously-difficult-to-get-more-than-10-fps games. Available now is some motherly love for your laps in the form of &lt;a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/geforce_8800m.html">8800M GTX &lt;/a>with its M1730. But that&amp;rsquo;s not all, it slaps onto the lappy not one, but two GFX cards in one. Yes, men, you heard that right &amp;ldquo;SLI&amp;rdquo; &lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/smile1.gif" alt="">.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/dell_8800.jpg" alt="Dell_8800">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>And those who are just beginning to get those puddles forming around the corners of their eyes because they bought their M1730&amp;rsquo;s with the slightly retro 8700&amp;rsquo;s, Dell loves you as well, because you, my dear friends, get an option to upgrade to the latest and greatest as well (US only as of now, but would soon be offered to Europe, AP customers as well).&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>BlogJet - Blog Faster, Blog Better (Now In Linux too, with a hidden bonus)</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/01/29/blogjet-blog-faster-blog-better-now-in-linux-too-with-a-hidden-bonus/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jan 2008 15:30:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/01/29/blogjet-blog-faster-blog-better-now-in-linux-too-with-a-hidden-bonus/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/blogjet_in_linux.png" alt="BlogJet in Linux" title="BlogJet in Linux">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In fact, the current crop of Linux based blog clients is at best childish, compared to these. A piece of software called &lt;a href="http://www.larryborsato.com/bleezer/">Bleezer&lt;/a> did offer a good set of features and supported linux as well, but turned out it was so crash-y, hogged up enormous amounts of ram, and had other issues that come usually packed with all java apps. But I wasn&amp;rsquo;t gonna boot into WinDUHs, just for one sole software, was I?? Sure, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/smile1.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">. I tried the usual routine of trying to run them through wine but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t supported. I resorted to my faithful ol&amp;rsquo; google, and chanced across &lt;a href="http://www.thetechandcents.com/2007/11/running-zoundry-blog-editor-under-wine.html">this little nugget&lt;/a>, with step by step instructions to achieve my goal. And it had a bonus. It told me about &lt;a href="http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/page/Main_Page">IEs4Linux&lt;/a> (IE&amp;rsquo;s For Linux). yes, you read correctly. You can run Internet Explorer on your Linux box as well. All this in under 10 minutes (Ubuntu wins again).

A google search is going to even confuse you further. As you wade into this enormous ocean, you will be wowed by the offers given by some of these hosts, throwing away 100&amp;rsquo;s of GBs (no less) of disk space and bandwidth running into terrabytes. Almost every software on earth in your one-click fantastico arsenal. (plus they promise to do your dishes after you are through with the dinner too). All this and more for a measly 3.99, 4.99, 5.99 and such price. Your jaw already touching the floor, you make a quick dash for your wallet, flip out your credit card, and sign up for that &amp;ldquo;limited time&amp;rdquo; offer for unlimited webspace before it expires. You then laugh at your friend who got a measly 100mb for the same price. But, what gives? Even a 100 GB hdd costs me close to 40-50 bucks, then how come they are able to do it?&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>One thing that is most difficult to choose (after a dress for your girlfriend that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make her &amp;ldquo;look&amp;rdquo; fat) is choosing a webhost.

&lt;p>There is no great Indian rope trick around it. The answer lies in just one term &amp;ldquo;oversell&amp;rdquo;. Yes, they oversell their available disk space and bandwidth to the tunes of 10s to 1000s of times, knowing that an average user will never use it up. Even if you do, then your account will be mysteriously suspended for &amp;ldquo;violating the AUP&amp;rdquo;. The AUP practically bans you from doing anything. It is a blend of the most hideous legal jargon signing on which might be equal to bequething all your savings to the host and you will never even come to know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, this post is just meant to be a word of caution for you to stay away from all those big and small names, purportedly touted as the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; on gazillions of sites across the web, and think again. If its too good to be true, it probably is.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>AMD has been taking a lot of flak lately in its processor business, and a similar (albeit milder) thrashing was being given to its ATi Gfx line up as well.

If you have ever looked into the WinMob world, its pretty much common knowledge that HTC owns the 95% of market share of this niche little space. They are a huge organization and with huge profits and they do make jolly good phones. BUT it is not the quality of phones that helped them reach this height.

&lt;p>Each phone seems to give one extra &amp;ldquo;feature&amp;rdquo; (read UI enhancement) over the latter. With Kaiser, it seemed too good to be true, getting a one in all phone. And it indeed was. As I pointed out &lt;a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=1767873&amp;amp;postcount=389">here&lt;/a> , it finally turned into a reality against all hopes of fellow WinMo owners, and HTC &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/01/25/htc-further-responds-to-video-driver-issue-will-improve-future/">declared&lt;/a> that nothing is coming for the current crop.
