Now, the things that is left to be evaluated is that how much of it is actually true, or whether there are some binary blobs still in there. Moreover, it remains to be seen that how much this converts into a “community” project instead of being ruled by Google with an iron hand. But given the interest that Android has generated so far, and given google’s reputation as a good open source promoter, I am ready to believe that this is going to be one of the biggest landmarks that mobile FOSS industry will see. And maybe, this will finally motivate me as well to get involved in the “bigger picture” finally by contributing to a project that is more than just a few thousand lines of source. What is your opinion and expectation from this development? Let me know.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) community rejoices today as google finally lived upto their promise of &lt;a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2008/10/android-open-source-cell-phone.html">releasing&lt;/a> the &lt;a href="http://source.android.com/">android source code&lt;/a>.
