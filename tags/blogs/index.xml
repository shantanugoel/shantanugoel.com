Post attachments are oh-so-2007. Uploading files to your server and hand-posting links everywhere is a pain in the butt. And what about your hunger for statistics?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, if you agree with me, then i would like to tell you about two fantastic plugins:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://urbangiraffe.com/plugins/drain-hole/">Drain Hole&lt;/a>:&lt;/strong> This is a real time saver. Some of the features are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Automatic scanning of directories to generate downloadable files.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Simple interface to upload files&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Categorized downloads&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>SEO urls (no more of those weird links)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Automatic hotlink protection&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Simple integration with SVN repositories&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Can maintain versions of the files (cool !!)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Download urls can be different from their actual path in your server&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Can even pick files from directories residing out of your www or public_html directory.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Superior download security by assigning permissions based on WordPress user roles.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Template tags allow you to insert any particular file(s) or list of all files or files in particular folder on any post, page, sidebar widget&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Statistics - no. of downloads, IP addresses, referrers, etc&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Can force files like php, html, txt etc to be downloaded rather than displaying in browser&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Pretty, can attach icons to files for displaying, different templates can be used for displaying files&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>and…..AJAX &lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/smile1.gif" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>phew, lemme catch my breath here…you can download it from &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/drain-hole/">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://software.y-zone.net/?page_id=3">WP-Vault&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>: This is the second best plugin I could find in this category. It is not as feature rich as Drain Hole, e.g., it misses SEO URls, hotlink protection, svn integration, versioning, etc, but it does have its own set of interesting features:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>get files from FTP/HTTP directly without downloading to computer first. (a real time saver)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Image galleries from stored images.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Supports WordPress&amp;rsquo; caching mechanism to reduce load on database.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>You can take your own pick out of the two. And yeah, this blog uses Drain Hole, if you must ask.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>BlogJet - Blog Faster, Blog Better (Now In Linux too, with a hidden bonus)</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/01/29/blogjet-blog-faster-blog-better-now-in-linux-too-with-a-hidden-bonus/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jan 2008 15:30:27 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/01/29/blogjet-blog-faster-blog-better-now-in-linux-too-with-a-hidden-bonus/</guid><description>A quick googling for best desktop blogging client would yield just a few (read millions/gazillions) results.

&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>In fact, the current crop of Linux based blog clients is at best childish, compared to these. A piece of software called &lt;a href="http://www.larryborsato.com/bleezer/">Bleezer&lt;/a> did offer a good set of features and supported linux as well, but turned out it was so crash-y, hogged up enormous amounts of ram, and had other issues that come usually packed with all java apps. But I wasn’t gonna boot into WinDUHs, just for one sole software, was I?? Sure, I wasn’t &lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/smile1.gif" alt="">. I tried the usual routine of trying to run them through wine but it wasn’t supported. I resorted to my faithful ol’ google, and chanced across &lt;a href="http://www.thetechandcents.com/2007/11/running-zoundry-blog-editor-under-wine.html">this little nugget&lt;/a>, with step by step instructions to achieve my goal. And it had a bonus. It told me about &lt;a href="http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/page/Main_Page">IEs4Linux&lt;/a> (IE’s For Linux). yes, you read correctly. You can run Internet Explorer on your Linux box as well. All this in under 10 minutes (Ubuntu wins again). And yeah, don’t forget to say thanks to me (and &lt;a href="http://www.thetechandcents.com/2007/11/running-zoundry-blog-editor-under-wine.html">Alex&lt;/a> as well).&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
