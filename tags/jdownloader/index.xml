JDownloader doesn't have an installer but a zip file that you just download and extract somewhere on your PC and start using it. Somehow, the Flashgot extension of Firefox is not able to detect it automatically and I didn't know what parameters to use to add it manually to its list. Latest versions of JDownloader ask you whether you want to install Flashgot or not.</description></item></channel></rss>
