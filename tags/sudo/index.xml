But the problem I faced was that my programs were compiling and running without any errors but I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t see the effect happening, i.e., the events weren&amp;rsquo;t getting injected into the system. I am using Ubuntu Maverick Meerkat (10.10) and when I searched on the net, I saw various other folks are facing the same issue. I finally got it working and here is how.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First problem I came across was that I was using &amp;ldquo;/dev/input/uinput&amp;rdquo; path in my programs but it seems it is changed to &amp;ldquo;/dev/uinput&amp;rdquo; in Ubuntu. Changing this got me past some runtime errors I was getting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I thought that the issue was because uinput module wasn&amp;rsquo;t getting loaded because even after specifically doing a modprobe, I still couldn&amp;rsquo;t see it loaded when I did lsmod. This was strange because the /dev/uinput node was present. On looking under /lib, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even find the uinput.ko file. But then I found that the reason for this is that in Ubuntu Maverick, uinput is not a module anymore. It is built into the kernel now. (See this &lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bluez/+bug/584812">launchpad bug&lt;/a>.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, having figured that the above was a false alarm, I was at a loss how to explain this. But then I tried just changing the permissions of the uinput node to 0666 (i.e. writable by all users) and ran my program without sudo and it worked like a charm. Searching for sudo along with uinput lead me to &lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sudo/+bug/609645">these&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://www.sudo.ws/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=388">bugs&lt;/a> which confirms that the problem is because of this only. So, if you are facing this issue, you can either change the uinput node permissions or install the sudo patch described in the bug discussion page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let me know if this worked for you as well :)&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>[Ubuntu TIP] Solved: Totem Cannot Detect UPnP Media Server</title><link>/2009/01/31/ubuntu-tip-solved-totem-cannot-detect-upnp-media-server/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2009 17:46:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2009/01/31/ubuntu-tip-solved-totem-cannot-detect-upnp-media-server/</guid><description>First a bit of background. A UPnP media server can serve your media files (video / audio / pictures) over the network to any compatible player. Some of the most known examples of these media servers are MediaTomb, TVersity, ushare, etc. In linux, few players can play media off these servers natively, but many require a plugin / library called &amp;ldquo;coherence&amp;rdquo;. e.g. the default media players (Totem and RhythmBox) can detect and play media from media servers once you install coherence (&amp;ldquo;sudo apt-get install python-coherence&amp;rdquo;).</description><content>&lt;p>First a bit of background.

This works, BUT you will see that many times Totem will stop detecting the server suddenly. It happens to me quite a bit (The server I use is Mediatomb). First I thought that the problem is with Media Tomb, but my PS3 continued to play videos from it over wi-fi without any issues, so that was ruled out. I tried many things but in the end, the solution turned out to be pretty simple. The problem seems to be that the coherence library hangs some times. Simple thing is to just restart it. So, all you need to do is run the following command:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>sudo killall coherence&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, just restart Totem and it will work fine now (Totem will invoke coherence again automatically). :)&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
