But the media server that is included in the official firmware leaves a lot to be desired. If you are a fan of twonky, all you would have heard so far would have been that to use it on your router, you&amp;rsquo;d have to change your firmware over to a non-official one. If you do not want to take any risks with the custom firmwares, I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you a simple way to use twonky with the stock firmware itself. Follow these steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Download Twonky (The MIPS version) and extract/save it to some place on the harddisk attached to your router (e.g. /tmp/harddisk/part0/twonky/ )&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Create a new shell script for starting twonky automatically (Replace the paths according to where you stored the twonky files in step 1). All you need to do is create a text file with following contents and mark it as executable. We&amp;rsquo;ll name it init.sh.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">#!/bin/sh
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">&lt;/span>route add -net 224.0.0.0 netmask 240.0.0.0 dev br0
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>cd /tmp/harddisk/part0/twonky&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/br&amp;gt;/tmp/harddisk/part0/twonky/twonkymedia &amp;amp;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Copy this script to your harddisk to where you extracted twonky files.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Open up the router&amp;rsquo;s web administration page (most probably at 192.168.1.1), go to the USB section, and put the following line under &amp;ldquo;Initial Script&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>`/tmp/harddisk/part0/twonky/init.sh``&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="5">
&lt;li>Save, reboot and enjoy :)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>If you have any questions, let me know. Infact, the same tip can be used to install many other such softwares onto your Asus routers series including WL-500g, WL-500gP, WL-500W, etc.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
