It&amp;rsquo;s claim to fame being an awesome virtual surround sound headset which also does the double duty of providing game audio as well as voice chat over the same headset. I preferred this over the Sony PS3 Elite headset as the PX5 is more generic and can work across multiple devices since it uses the regular bluetooth for A2DP and voice chat and the wireless transmitter has standard optical/RCA inputs and outputs.</description><content>&lt;p>So I got this beautiful piece of headset a few days ago, called the EarForce PX5 by TurtleBeach.

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>However, there was one issue. Out of the box, the headset produced serious amount of clicks and pops and other static noises. This is because the wireless transmission for this headset is done over 2.4 GHz band which competes with the various wireless devices that I have around the house. Trying various tools like inSSIDer proved useless as the PX5 isn&amp;rsquo;t a WLAN/802.11 connection evne though it uses the same band. Finally after lot of trial and error, I figured out that doing the following things reduced the noise down to a bare minimum (in fact zero):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Use Channel 9 on the wi-fi router for 2.4GHz band with band width being 20MHz&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Keep the transmitter away from PS3&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Keep the transmitter away from the TV (It&amp;rsquo;s surprising how much the EMI emitting from those huge LCDs can affect wireless performance.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now, it&amp;rsquo;s working awesomely and I just had a decent run of the missing link DLC of Deus Ex HR :)&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>KillZone 2 Steel-Book Edition is here</title><link>/2009/02/20/killzone-2-steel-book-edition-is-here/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2009 21:47:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2009/02/20/killzone-2-steel-book-edition-is-here/</guid><description>Note: Please DIGG this post by clicking here or Reddit this post by clicking here.
I&amp;rsquo;ll be one of the proud owners of a very special steel book edition of Killzone 2 very soon. The cool part being that it&amp;rsquo;d be much before most of the rest of the world gets to even see these little babies because the official release date is still five days away. And the icing on the cake &amp;ldquo;A free classic Art Book&amp;rdquo;.</description><content>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note: Please &lt;a href="http://digg.com/playstation/KillZone_2_Steel_Book_Edition_is_here">DIGG this post by clicking here&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/7z1u7/killzone_2_steelbook_edition_is_here/">Reddit this post by clicking here&lt;/a>.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Ask any laptop user about how much he liked to kick some butt in Gears of War and he would cringe and cry with agony even before you are able to say the &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rdquo; of Crysis. But not anymore. For its notebook consumers, Dell has finally come up with the &lt;a href="http://direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2008/01/29/43163.aspx">perfect answer&lt;/a> to the questions posed by these ridiculously-difficult-to-get-more-than-10-fps games. Available now is some motherly love for your laps in the form of &lt;a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/geforce_8800m.html">8800M GTX &lt;/a>with its M1730. But that&amp;rsquo;s not all, it slaps onto the lappy not one, but two GFX cards in one. Yes, men, you heard that right &amp;ldquo;SLI&amp;rdquo; &lt;img src="/img/uploads/smile1.gif" alt="">.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And those who are just beginning to get those puddles forming around the corners of their eyes because they bought their M1730&amp;rsquo;s with the slightly retro 8700&amp;rsquo;s, Dell loves you as well, because you, my dear friends, get an option to upgrade to the latest and greatest as well (US only as of now, but would soon be offered to Europe, AP customers as well).&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>AMD (ATi) Step Up The Tempo</title><link>/2008/01/28/amd-ati-step-up-the-tempo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jan 2008 16:01:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2008/01/28/amd-ati-step-up-the-tempo/</guid><description>AMD has been taking a lot of flak lately in its processor business, and a similar (albeit milder) thrashing was being given to its ATi Gfx line up as well.
