It&amp;rsquo;s claim to fame being an awesome virtual surround sound headset which also does the double duty of providing game audio as well as voice chat over the same headset.

I&amp;rsquo;ll be one of the proud owners of a very special steel book edition of Killzone 2 very soon. The cool part being that it&amp;rsquo;d be much before most of the rest of the world gets to even see these little babies because the official release date is still five days away. And the icing on the cake &amp;ldquo;A free classic Art Book&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>All Your Base Are Belong To Us - Says Dell</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/01/30/all-your-base-are-belong-to-us-says-dell/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jan 2008 18:27:55 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/01/30/all-your-base-are-belong-to-us-says-dell/</guid><description>Ask any laptop user about how much he liked to kick some butt in Gears of War and he would cringe and cry with agony even before you are able to say the &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rdquo; of Crysis. But not anymore. For its notebook consumers, Dell has finally come up with the perfect answer to the questions posed by these ridiculously-difficult-to-get-more-than-10-fps games. Available now is some motherly love for your laps in the form of 8800M GTX with its M1730.</description></item><item><title>AMD (ATi) Step Up The Tempo</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/01/28/amd-ati-step-up-the-tempo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jan 2008 16:01:45 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/01/28/amd-ati-step-up-the-tempo/</guid><description>AMD has been taking a lot of flak lately in its processor business, and a similar (albeit milder) thrashing was being given to its ATi Gfx line up as well.

All you gamers, please stop drooling on the screen now, and check out some benchmarks.</description></item></channel></rss>
