Armed with my laptop and multiple flasks of coffee, the marathon began on Friday night. My only experience with web-related development so far had been around 8–10 years ago as a kid when, just like everybody else at that time, I was fascinated by HTML and did a “read-through” of HTML 4.0. But I have always been a believer of the theory that a C programmer can program in any language quickly without having to go through the whole manuals. Thus that night bore fruit for me, and by 5:30 in the morning I had a working “Quote of The Day” plugin at my hand with all the features I wanted it to have in its first avatar. Did a bit of polishing last night, fixed a few bugs, and created a readme, and here it is, Mr. shantz-wp-qotd “1.0”, in all its glory, ready for general consumption.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>== Installation ==&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Shantz-WP-QOTD plugin can be installed in following easy steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Unzip &amp;ldquo;shantz-wp-qotd&amp;rdquo; archive and put all files into your &amp;ldquo;plugins&amp;rdquo; folder (/wp-content/plugins/). It is advisable to create a sub directory into the plugins folder, like /wp-content/plugins/shantz-wp-qotd/&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Activate the plugin&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Go to Options &amp;gt; Shantz WP Quotes, adjust your settings and save them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>For adding and configuring widget to sidebar, go to Presentation &amp;gt; Widgets.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>== Frequently Asked Questions ==&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>= How to add quotes anywhere in the posts/pages? =
Use the tag &lt;code>&amp;lt;!-- shantz-wp-qotd {option} --&amp;gt;&lt;/code> anywhere in your post (without the quotes).
Note:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>{option} (including the braces) has to be replaced by the quote pattern that you want: qotd, qottd or r. qotd is quote of the day, qottd is quote of that day and r is random.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The tag has to be added using the code editor and not the visual editor, otherwise it will replace the &amp;lt;, &amp;gt; with their HTML equivalents.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>= How to use the custom separator/multi-line quotes? =
By default, if you leave the custom separator box blank, the plugin uses a newline character as the separator. However, if you have quotes that have multiple lines, you can change this to a tag of your choice, say [quote]. Now, in your quotes file (or quotes pasted in admin panel options) add this tag at the end of each quote and you are done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>= What is the format for saving quotes? =
In text box in admin page, as well as in the file, the quotes have to be saved as one on each line. Each quote is separate by newline.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>= Where is the file with quotes located =&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the get from file option, a file &amp;ldquo;quotes.txt&amp;rdquo; has to be present in the same directory where shantz-wp-qotd.php is residing. A sample quotes.txt has been given with this plugin (with some quotes from southpark, simpsons, matrix and deus ex)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>= I checked the option &amp;ldquo;exclude pages&amp;rdquo; but my pages are still displaying quotes =
Check your WordPress version. This option is effective only for Version 2.1 and above&lt;/p>
&lt;p>= How to upgrade to a new version =
Simply overwrite the old files with the new ones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>== Screenshots ==&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
