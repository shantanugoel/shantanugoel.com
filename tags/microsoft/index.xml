Many also say that Windows Phone 7 is a threat to Android because it solves the problem of Apple&amp;rsquo;s draconian policies, gives choice to customers and all this without fragmenting the OS all over the place.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>Many people say that Windows Phone 7 is a threat to iPhone because they are bringing in a super platform with a choice of multiple designs and multiple carriers with great Enterprise and gaming support and maintaining the lucrative integration that iPhone provides. Many also say that Windows Phone 7 is a threat to Android because it solves the problem of Apple&amp;rsquo;s draconian policies, gives choice to customers and all this without fragmenting the OS all over the place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, I beg to differ. Windows Phone 7 is a threat to the world wide web and web apps. It plans to help the developers and users by going one up on fragmentation of Android but in the process will fragment the web app world itself. This is because the browser in WP7 is based on Internet Explorer 7. Yes, not IE 9, not IE8, but IE7, which is already four years old now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Right now, if you have to do a web app, you can do it in HTML5, CSS3 etc and assume that it will work over most mobile handsets out there. Enter WP7 with its archaic browser and the developer has one more headache to solve. His app will be, in most cases, incompatible with the &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; platform and so he will have to code another version that works on IE7 as well. This will not only result in wasted time and effort but in fact, the developer may even have to hold back on features that might not work well on this ugly duckling which will hold the whole pack down for God knows how much more time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, there it is. If the Android fragmentation reports are true, you can just buy another handset like an iPhone but this comeback-from-the-grave monster will fragment the mobile web app world itself so that you won&amp;rsquo;t have any reprieve whichever phone you buy. So, I appeal to you. If you want a better mobile future, talk about it, write about it and let Microsoft know that it can and must do better.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Boycott Novell Protestors Manhandled By National Free Software Conference 2008 Organizers</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/11/16/boycott-novell-protestors-manhandled-by-national-free-software-conference-2008-organizers/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2008 09:38:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/11/16/boycott-novell-protestors-manhandled-by-national-free-software-conference-2008-organizers/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a really sad day. Not only the organizers of National Conference On Free Software 2008 taking place at CUSAT seem to be utterly misguided when they decided to let Novell be on-board as their main sponsor, they even took the extreme step of bringing in police to silence the lone voices of the Boycott Novell protestors. They seem to be treading on the toes of not just free software but free speech as well, which is against the very ethics of the conference they are holding. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure whether the conference organizers took this step on their own or in cahoots with Novell-Microsoft &amp;ldquo;gang&amp;rdquo; but whatever happened was unfortunate.

According to it, the patents granted for business practices would have to undergo specific and stringent testing procedures to check the worthiness of granting a patent to it. Essentially, they are aiming to mandate a passing of &amp;ldquo;machine-or-transformation test&amp;rdquo; as a pre-requisite for granting a patent. This means that a mere &amp;ldquo;idea in my head&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t qualify for a patent until it is put into practice on a machine or can transform the state of an object for a specific purpose. Am no lawyer but what the experts are making out from the long judgement is that many industries will be hit hard by this ruling. Especially software companies who own most of the software patents as business practices, and a majority of these would be found unworthy of patents as they would be found too generic and stifling for the growth of industry.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>Just read over at groklaw about a ruling made last night by the US Appeals Court.

&lt;p>So, companies like Microsoft would have a lot to rue about as a huge portion of their patent portfolio has become circumspect. This not only would rob them of revenues in terms of royalties but would also open up a lot of space for competition as well. Special thanks to Red Hat to take up the fight and providing crucial data to the court to take this decision. Stallman and FSF would be very happy today :)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I began thinking on the lines of setting up a ramdisk first (and remapping the browser cache folders to the new path in this ramdisk), so that nothing gets written to the hard disk, ever, even if the browser tries very hard. Best security right? Yes, but it involved a few issues like data is still there until you reboot also a part of your ram is always blocked, etc. So I went with the approach given below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Method: Easier and privacy on-par with Chrome/IE8&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just do the following in addition to the Step 4.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Uncheck &amp;ldquo;Keep my history&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Uncheck &amp;ldquo;Remember what I enter in forms and the search bar&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Uncheck &amp;ldquo;Remember what I&amp;rsquo;ve downloaded&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Choose &amp;ldquo;Keep until I close firefox&amp;rdquo; for cookies&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Press advanced settings in &amp;ldquo;Private Data&amp;rdquo;, select unselect options according to your choice. For max protection, select everything.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Open a new tab, and write &amp;ldquo;about:config&amp;rdquo; (without quotes) in address bar, press enter.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Search for &amp;ldquo;browser.cache.disk.enable&amp;rdquo; and set it to false&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Search for &amp;ldquo;browser.cache.offline.enable&amp;rdquo; and set it to false&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Done. You are secure and remember, this is just a one time setup, you won&amp;rsquo;t have to do this again and again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side Note: Usability is another concern. However, I think that is debatable and varies from user to user highly. The steps lined up in these 2 posts aren&amp;rsquo;t too hard to carry out and take around a minute to do, and is a one time effort. Now, compare this with option where you use google chrome and love its in-built incognito mode but then have to leave all the extensions and greasemonkey scripts of firefox behind which made browsing so much more accessible for you. Another path could be to use both the browsers. Anyways, I&amp;rsquo;ll not go further down this path. This is for you to decide what you feel is more usable for you :) . This is just something to say &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not impossible&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There has been so much hype over the “Incognito” (or Private Browsing) mode of Google Chrome / Microsoft IE8, with many internet users screeming Hallelujiah.

You just need to devote less than one minute (yes, you read that right, less than one minute) to set it up. Well, actions are better than words, so here it goes:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step 1.) Run the following command to start the firefox profile manager.(In Linux, press Alt+F2 and in Windows, press Win+R to bring up the run dialogue box)&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>firefox -ProfileManager
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>If it says something on the lines of “cannot find command” then use full path to firefox/firefox.exe in linux/Windows respectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/firefox_2Dprofile_2Dmanager.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/firefox_2Dprofile_2Dmanager_thumb.jpg" alt="Firefox-profile-manager">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step 2.) Press “Create Profile” and enter “Incognito” (or a name of your choice) as your new profile name and press “Finish”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/firefox_2Dprofile_2Dmanager2.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/firefox_2Dprofile_2Dmanager2_thumb.jpg" alt="Firefox-profile-manager2">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step 3.) Select “Incognito” profile and press “Start Firefox”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/firefox_2Dprofile_2Dmanager3.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/firefox_2Dprofile_2Dmanager3_thumb.jpg" alt="Firefox-profile-manager3">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step 4.) Go to Edit-&amp;gt;Preferences-&amp;gt;Privacy. Select “Always clear my private data when I close Firefox” and unselect “Ask me before clearing private data”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/firefox_2Dprivacy_2Dpreferences.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/firefox_2Dprivacy_2Dpreferences_thumb.jpg" alt="Firefox-privacy-preferences">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step 5.) That’s it. Setup is done. Now, whenever you want to go undercover, run the following command&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>firefox -P Incognito -no-remote
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Note 1: You can run incognito mode and normal mode together simultaneously.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note 2: Its advised that you put the above command in a shortcut for easy/quick access.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Isn’t that simple? Now, can you roll back that drool factor of being able to go “undercover” in google chrome or Internet Explorer 8?&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Free Domain, Free Webhosting from Microsoft</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/27/free-domain-free-webhosting-from-microsoft/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2008 16:13:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/27/free-domain-free-webhosting-from-microsoft/</guid><description>&lt;p>Microsoft is doling out a lot of free stuff today.
