The motivation was that I needed to test a piece of code for a touchscreen driver that I had written at work.

The script is written in perl and works in windows as well as linux. Please read on to see the requirements, installation, usage and download link. I should also thank my colleague Rabindra Mandal, who gave me the initial idea and Thanassis Tsiodras, whose script I looked at before creating mine (though mine is quite different in nature.</description></item></channel></rss>
