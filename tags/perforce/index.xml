P4 help suggests the following ways to achieve this:
p4 sync @label1,label2
or something like
`p4 sync @label1,@label2``

&lt;p>But I&amp;rsquo;ve found that depending on the perforce version you are using, the above commands might not work. So, here is a tip that will always work for you irrespective of which version you are using:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>p4 files @label | cut --delimiter=&amp;quot; &amp;quot; -f1 | p4 -x - sync -n&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is as simple as that.

Hence, I like to do most of my work through command lines. Now, the other day I needed to add a directory and all its subdirectories and files to the repository (or perforce depot). This is a trivial task through the GUI. Just drag the top level directory onto the changelist area and the GUI takes care of everything but there is no straightforward way to do this through command line, until, I discovered the &amp;ldquo;-x&amp;rdquo; option of P4.</description><content>&lt;p>Perforce is an excellent revision control system for the code but the GUIs (P4WIN and P4V) are too slow to be productive.

Just drag the top level directory onto the changelist area and the GUI takes care of everything but there is no straightforward way to do this through command line, until, I discovered the &amp;ldquo;-x&amp;rdquo; option of P4. So, here it is how to achieve this. Run the following command after cd&amp;rsquo;ing to the directory you want to add:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For Unix/Linux (or if you have the unix utils installed in windows through GNUWin32, UnixUtils or Cygwin):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>find . -type f -print | p4 -x - add&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For Windows:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>dir /b /s /a-d | p4 -x - add&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
