&lt;p>A user going by the remarkably simple handle &amp;ldquo;email123&amp;rdquo; announced on the &lt;a href="http://xda-developers.com/">xda-developers &lt;/a>forum, that WM6.1 is here, alive and kicking. But he doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop there, he says that its available &amp;ldquo;now&amp;rdquo;, that too for an HTC wizard, a 3 year old phone (which I own as well). Thats not all, he goes on to provide the proof by linking in his cooked ROM for all to download. But, here is the clincher, he claims that finally &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://www.google.co.in/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=htc+big+storage+hack&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;amp;meta=">Big Storage&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo; is available for wizard, a feat noone has been able to achieve in the last 3 years. It means that an extra 10 MB is available to you as Device Memory. It seems to get better and better for our dear old wizard. After all, old is gold.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/Screen002.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/Screen002_thumb.jpg" alt="Screen002">&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/Screen003.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/Screen003_thumb.jpg" alt="Screen003">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
