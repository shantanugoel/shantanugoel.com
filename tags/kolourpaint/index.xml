Note that I didn&amp;rsquo;t go for GIMP / Inkscape etc because they were overkill for what I wanted to do. Many a times, I just wanted to touch up a screenshot or make a simple flow image by drawing a few boxes, use a few pointing arrows, and add some text here and there. All this could be done with the previous mentioned programs as well but took a bit more steps than I wanted (stroking the selections / paths for lines, boxes, circles, and even then, no arrows). I didn&amp;rsquo;t find an adequate replacement at the time but got it now, so thought of writing about it. Basically I came across 4 apps: tuxpaint, gpaint, kolourpaint and mtpaint. Won&amp;rsquo;t discuss tuxpaint here cuz I found it a little too kiddish.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>gpaint: (Available in Ubuntu repositories) gpaint is a very simplistic program that has a mspaint look and feel but feels a bit lacking. It can do basic procedures like basic shape selections, lines, boxes but that&amp;rsquo;s it. No polygon selections, brush, color picker, etc, and yeah no arrows. Moreover, it saves only in pngs.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/gpaint.png">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/gpaint-thumb.png" alt="gpaint screenshot">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>kolourpaint: (Available in Ubuntu Repositories) kolourpaint is very close to mspaint. Infact it does a bit more than mspaint. It has all the things that I mentioned as missing in gpaint, plus has basic image manipulation effects as well. I liked it quite a bit, but it had 2 drawbacks for me, still no arrows, and it depends on KDE/Qt libraries.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/kolourpaint.png">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/kolourpaint-thumb.png" alt="kolourpaint screenshot">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>mtpaint: (Available in Ubuntu Repositories from Gutsy onwards. Rest of the folks can search for a package on net, or find a suitable package or source &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=155874&amp;amp;package_id=173703">here&lt;/a>) This is the software that got me most excited. It is actually a kind of lower-intermediate package that lies somewhere between mspaint and a very basic, poor man&amp;rsquo;s GIMP. It has all the features ok kolourpaint, (plus arrows at last :-) ), a small smattering of basic effects (gaussian, edge detection, blur, embossing), can work with gifs also (handles transparency and animation quite well). So, this is the one I would be sticking to for now.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/mtpaint.png">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/mtpaint-thumb.png" alt="mtpaint screenshot">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am using mtpaint now for my basic needs. Hope the article benefitted you as well. If I missed out on some package, then do let me know.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Wanted: A Good Paint Program For Linux</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/03/wanted-a-good-paint-program-for-linux/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2008 12:47:23 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/03/wanted-a-good-paint-program-for-linux/</guid><description>Have been in the hunt for a good basic paint program for linux for so long. I&amp;rsquo;m running a Ubuntu Feisty Fawn (amd64) box (yeah, yeah I didn&amp;rsquo;t upgrade to Gutsy because it sneaked up too quickly onto me and the impending loom of LTS goodness of Hardy was also there). Have been suggested various things so far like GPaint, Kolourpaint, tuxpaint etc but none of them cuts it.
Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I love GIMP but its an overkill when I have to go through 2 menus, a dialogue box and several clicks, just to make a silly rectangle, but I don&amp;rsquo;t hold anything against it cuz afterall its an &amp;ldquo;Image Manipulation&amp;rdquo; program, not a painting one.</description><content>&lt;p>Have been in the hunt for a good basic paint program for linux for so long.

&lt;p>So, what do you use/recommend when you have to draw a few basic shapes, connect them through lines and arrows, put in a mashup of few silly pics and colorize it a bit with basic effects? And are there any gnome native ones or do I ultimately have to give in to install KDE dependencies?&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
