Earlier I had done this using my Odroid U2 and Tasker/AutoRemote but this was limiting as this meant that I could see the notifications only when I was watching something through the Odroid. Samsung TVs, which are DLNA enabled, also include a hidden service called &amp;ldquo;Message Box&amp;rdquo; which can display different information on the TV natively irrespective of which display mode/input mode you are in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had come across this while reverse engineering the DLNA protocol extensions that Samsung had built in their TVs to get subtitles working over DLNA but didn&amp;rsquo;t put much thought into it. Fueled by the new Raspberry Pi I recently acquired (more on this later below), I set out to find out the details of this service and exploit it for my need and a few hours later, samsung-messagebox was born :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can get it from here: &lt;a href="https://github.com/shantanugoel/samsung-messagebox">https://github.com/shantanugoel/samsung-messagebox&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Usage:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> usage: samsung-msgbox.py -i IP -m MSG [-p PORT] [-t TIME] [-r RECEIVER]
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> [-x RECEIVER_NO] [-s SENDER] [-y SENDER_NO] [-h]
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Send an arbitrary text message to Samsung TVs which is displayed onscreen.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Developed by Shantanu Goel (http://tech.shantanugoel.com/) version 1.0
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Arguments:
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> -i IP, --ip IP Required. IP Address of the TV
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> -m MSG, --msg MSG Required. Message body text to be sent to TV
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> -p PORT, --port PORT Optional. Port on which message should be sent
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> -t TIME, --time TIME Optional. Receive date and time in epoch/unix format
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> -r RECEIVER, --receiver RECEIVER
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Optional. Receiver Name
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> -x RECEIVER_NO, --receiverno RECEIVER_NO
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Optional. Receiver Number
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> -s SENDER, --sender SENDER
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Optional. Sender Name
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> -y SENDER_NO, --senderno SENDER_NO
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Optional. Sender Number
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> -h, --help
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve tested it currently with my 2010 C Series TV. Hopefully, it should work with any TV that has this service. If you face any problems then let me know and I can try to add support for your TV.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Raspberry PI:&lt;/strong> So, where does raspberry pi figure in all this? Well, I wanted to display my incoming call/text alerts on my TV. So, I made a small webserver in python that I run on my raspberry pi, listening for some special parameters. Whenever I get a call or SMS, I created a tasker profile to call this server with the call/sms parameters and the server in turn calls the above samsung-messagebox.py script to display the alerts. I&amp;rsquo;m also planning to integrate it with a dropbox based service to put it to more uses. Let me know if you have any ideas in mind.&lt;/p>

**Overscan: **
So, many TVs have this issue that they miss out on displaying the corners of the image put out by the Odroid U2. The phenomenon is called overscan. Now, all you have to do is select settings such as &amp;ldquo;Just Scan&amp;rdquo; or similar on your TV that allows your TV to display image coming from U2 as is.</description><content>&lt;p>So I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending a few hours on getting my odroid u2 up and running and here are a few tips that I&amp;rsquo;ve come across in the process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Overscan: **&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, many TVs have this issue that they miss out on displaying the corners of the image put out by the Odroid U2. The phenomenon is called overscan. Now, all you have to do is select settings such as &amp;ldquo;Just Scan&amp;rdquo; or similar on your TV that allows your TV to display image coming from U2 as is. This setting is called &amp;ldquo;Screen Fit&amp;rdquo; on Samsung TVs but I found something weird. My TV already had this setting set for the picture mode, but still I had the overscan issue. What I had to do was to switch to another mode and then back to Screen Fit and it started working fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>emmc Adapter:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The emmc adapter that hardkernel/odroid folks send out with the board to use with a microsd card reader doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to work. However, the issue is that it is slightly bigger than a regular microsd and hence doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit properly inside the reader. All I had to do was to file the top edges a bit and then it worked fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>HDMI-DVI Adapter:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently I&amp;rsquo;ve attached it to my old Samsung B2030 monitor. A tip btw for B2030 owners (or anyone else having a monitor with only DVI input and not HDMI). Despite many folks (including hardkernel/odroid guys) saying that HDMI to DVI adapters are not supported and won&amp;rsquo;t work, they do work but the thing is that the monitor should be turned on before turning on the U2 otherwise U2 doesn&amp;rsquo;t output anything over the HDMI and the monitor won&amp;rsquo;t display anything.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Odroid U2 is here</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2013/01/12/odroid-u2-is-here/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jan 2013 17:46:57 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2013/01/12/odroid-u2-is-here/</guid><description>So, this little baby landed up in my mailbox a couple of days ago :).

&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The interesting thing however is the 3 dots on the left side&lt;/strong>. People claim that it could be related to camera or volume controls or even speaker grills. But I think that they are for dock connection. Anyone who has owned a Nexus One has seen the same 3 gold dots on the bottom used for dock connection. I believe that on Nexus Prime they have been moved to the side mainly because Prime has (or is supposed to have) a 16:9 screen and hence the optimal placement in a dock would be horizontal and hence the sideways placement.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Let me know what you think :)&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
