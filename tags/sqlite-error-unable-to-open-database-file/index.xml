It had something to do with sqlite and gave a vague message &amp;ldquo;Unable to open database file&amp;rdquo;. After going bonkers for a short time, I solved it and this is how.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of my hard disks crashed recently and unfortunately it was the one I had connected to my router to serve media to me all over the house (through PS3/laptop) or when I travel (through laptop/phone). I had all the data backed up but somehow didn&amp;rsquo;t preserve the firefly server. I rebuilt the server from source using my &lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/2009/07/03/compiling-latest-firefly-mt-daapd-asus-wl-500w.html">own guide&lt;/a> (Thank God I did it. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been able to preserve my sanity finding all that out the hard way again.). But after doing all the installation and reconfiguration, it gave me a weird error &amp;ldquo;unable to open database file&amp;rdquo; every time and exited. I checked the permissions on the songs3.db file (in /opt/var/cache/mt-daapd for me) and made it writable by all but the issue persisted. I changed its ownership to the user under which firefly was running but the issue was still there. Finally I found that the server (or maybe its an sqlite thing) was trying to create a temp file in the cache directory for the transactions and since the user with which it was started, didn&amp;rsquo;t own the directory it wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to create the file in it.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>Recently I came across a weird error while trying to run firefly itunes server (mt-daapd) on my router (Asus wl-500w).

&lt;p>So, the fix: I did a &lt;code>chown &amp;lt;username&amp;gt; /opt/var/cache/mt-daapd&lt;/code> on it and voila! the problem was fixed. I am a happy man now since I own a new android phone since last time and now able to stream all my music to my phone through itunes (daap protocol) server over an ssh tunnel :)&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
