&lt;p>You should not upgrade to Ubuntu 9.04 (aka Jaunty Jackalope), released a few weeks ago, if:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You have an older ATI graphics card (prior to R500, .e.g xpress 200m)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You like to have 3D support (read compiz/games, etc)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This is because of the following reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Ubuntu Jaunty Jackalope has the new version of X.org server (1.6)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The open source graphics drivers for ATI do not have 3D support&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The only version of the ATI properietary drivers (fglrx\Catalyst) compatible with X.org server 1.6 is 9.4&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Support for older cards (mentioned above) was dropped from fglrx 9.4&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So, basically right now you are in a soup and it seems to me that this is going to remain this way unless someone figures out how to backport x.org 1.5 onto Jauntu, which is going to be a hell of a task, IMHO :P&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, if you are a simple person, who looks beyond the gloss of the 3D and marvels at the beauty that the rest of the system holds, then go right ahead and dive in :)&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
