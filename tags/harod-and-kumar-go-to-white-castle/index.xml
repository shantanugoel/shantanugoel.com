Cool movie, though not as awesome as &amp;ldquo;Go to White Castle&amp;rdquo; one. But one thing that I liked was the poem that Kumar (Kal Penn) recites in an attempt to woo back her love by embarrassing himself more than he had embarrassed her (Yes, you can see such situations only in H&amp;amp;K movies ;) ). The poem is actually written by one &amp;ldquo;David Feinberg&amp;rdquo;. And it may sound too geeky or lame to most normal people, but then again, we all know that I ain&amp;rsquo;t no normal fella. So, here it goes for your consumption (People who skipped maths in school might want to chew on a few appetizers first):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I fear that I will always be&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lonely number like root three&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The three is all that’s good and right,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why must my three keep out of sight&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beneath the vicious square root sign,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wish instead I were a nine&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For nine could thwart this evil trick,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>with just some quick arithmetic&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know I’ll never see the sun, as 1.7321&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Such is my reality, a sad irrationality&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When hark! What is this I see,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another square root of a three&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As quietly co-waltzing by,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Together now we multiply&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To form a number we prefer,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rejoicing as an integer&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We break free from our mortal bonds&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the wave of magic wands&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our square root signs become unglued&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your love for me has been renewed&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
