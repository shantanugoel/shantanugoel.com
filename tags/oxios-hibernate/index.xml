&lt;p>Oxios developed a very useful tool for Windows Mobile (WM2003/5/6/6.1) called &amp;ldquo;Oxios Memory&amp;rdquo; sometime ago. On running it, it&amp;rsquo;ll flush your RAM (kind of) and recover substantial amounts of memory that can be used by the currently program. It is so good at this that many people run it regularly on their phones, and most of them want to run it in an automated mode (through a scheduler or a script). But the problem (so far) was that it generates a Message Box at the end for which the user has to press &amp;ldquo;OK&amp;rdquo; button to make it go away. There is no known way of disabling this message box and many attempts to work around it by scripting the &amp;ldquo;press OK&amp;rdquo; action have been very unreliable at best. Hence, it took it upon me today to remove this nagging problem and 5 minutes later we have a &amp;ldquo;clean&amp;rdquo; Oxios Memory.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>**Update: **Modified the &amp;ldquo;Oxios Hibernate&amp;rdquo; app as well on public demand.

&lt;p>Yes, no more nagging prompts :)&lt;/p>
