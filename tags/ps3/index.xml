It&amp;rsquo;s claim to fame being an awesome virtual surround sound headset which also does the double duty of providing game audio as well as voice chat over the same headset. I preferred this over the Sony PS3 Elite headset as the PX5 is more generic and can work across multiple devices since it uses the regular bluetooth for A2DP and voice chat and the wireless transmitter has standard optical/RCA inputs and outputs.</description></item><item><title>Fixing the DS3/Sixaxis Controller Not Working in PSN Store Issue</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2013/01/13/fixing-the-ds3sixaxis-controller-not-working-in-psn-store-issue/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jan 2013 19:55:44 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2013/01/13/fixing-the-ds3sixaxis-controller-not-working-in-psn-store-issue/</guid><description>So, my wife got me a new slim PS3 today to replace my old YLOD&amp;rsquo;ed phat (Yes, Awesome wife I know. And slim PS3 cuz I hate the looks of the new superslim). But, I digress. The issue at hand is that everything worked fine when I unwrapped it, hooked it up to the power and TV and switched it on. However, once I started the PSN store (or what is now called Sony Entertainment Network Store), nothing worked.</description></item><item><title>Featured in Chip India August 2011 Edition</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2011/08/01/featured-in-chip-india-august-2011-edition/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2011 03:24:23 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2011/08/01/featured-in-chip-india-august-2011-edition/</guid><description>My project Kinect on PS3 got featured in this month&amp;rsquo;s Chip magazine :).

I also have a scanned image of the pages below.</description></item><item><title>Making Kinect Work With PS3</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2011/03/20/making-kinect-work-with-ps3/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Mar 2011 15:36:51 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2011/03/20/making-kinect-work-with-ps3/</guid><description>This post describes my first attempt at making Kinect work with a PS3. Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s new XBOX 360 accessory, kinect has made a powerful entry into the market, becoming the fastest selling gadget of all time. Looks like their &amp;ldquo;You are the controller&amp;rdquo; tagline is working. Of course, Sony&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;similar&amp;rdquo; accessory Move is selling well too but is far behind kinect adoption probably because nothing beats the lure of making something work with just &amp;ldquo;The Force&amp;rdquo; ;).</description></item><item><title>PSN Ban-Wave Phishing Scam</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2011/02/17/psn-ban-wave-phishing-scam/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Feb 2011 09:25:24 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2011/02/17/psn-ban-wave-phishing-scam/</guid><description>**Update: **I did some more digging and the email and the links actually seem to be legitimate. Good news for many, but bad for those who actually got this email.
BEWARE!! In wake of the recent announcement of a potential Playstation Network ban wave by Sony for the people who are hacking it&amp;rsquo;s gaming console PS3, some nefarious elements seem to be using this as an opportunity to pry on your PSN passwords.</description></item><item><title>Making Frets On Fire Work With Pulse Aludio - pasuspender</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/08/23/make-frets-on-fire-work-pulse-audio-pasuspender/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Aug 2009 18:18:45 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/08/23/make-frets-on-fire-work-pulse-audio-pasuspender/</guid><description>I recently got hold of a Guitar Hero controller for my PS3 but the game still had some time to come so I tried it out on my laptop with Frets on Fire (rather FoFix). But when I started it, it was crashing with some weird error about not being able to open mixer devices. Searching on the google, I came to know this is happening because of Pulse Audio as this application needs direct access to the sound devices and finally I came upon **pasuspender.</description></item><item><title>Killzone 2 Tips Tricks Tactics And Strategies : Engineer</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/08/09/killzone-2-tips-tricks-tactics-stategies-engineer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Aug 2009 16:45:04 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/08/09/killzone-2-tips-tricks-tactics-stategies-engineer/</guid><description>Killzone 2 (KZ2) is one of my most favourite games for the Playstation 3. Killzone 2 is a very different game as compared to the other run-of-the-mill FPS&amp;rsquo;s out there. Now, I might not be the best player out there but I&amp;rsquo;ve played my fair share of it. So, I thought of jotting down some quick points for the different classes, how to play them and how to make the most of them according to my opinion.</description></item><item><title>Microtek UPS Problems (And A Solution)</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/05/10/microtek-ups-problems-solution/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 May 2009 15:35:02 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/05/10/microtek-ups-problems-solution/</guid><description>I got myself a Microtek 800VA UPS (MDP800+) a couple of weeks ago to save my PS3 from the frequent power outages that we are seeing in Hyderabad but the purpose was rather lost when I found that it worked fine only till the mains power was on. As soon as there was an outage, it couldn’t stop the PS3 from an abrupt shut down. I ran around the pathetic Microtek customer service for days and they finally sent an “engineer” down to my place (after a week) to diagnose the issue and he couldn’t say anything more than that the UPS is meant for a PC and nothing else.</description></item></channel></rss>
