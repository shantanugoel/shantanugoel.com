It&amp;rsquo;s claim to fame being an awesome virtual surround sound headset which also does the double duty of providing game audio as well as voice chat over the same headset. I preferred this over the Sony PS3 Elite headset as the PX5 is more generic and can work across multiple devices since it uses the regular bluetooth for A2DP and voice chat and the wireless transmitter has standard optical/RCA inputs and outputs.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>So I got this beautiful piece of headset a few days ago, called the EarForce PX5 by TurtleBeach.

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>However, there was one issue. Out of the box, the headset produced serious amount of clicks and pops and other static noises. This is because the wireless transmission for this headset is done over 2.4 GHz band which competes with the various wireless devices that I have around the house. Trying various tools like inSSIDer proved useless as the PX5 isn&amp;rsquo;t a WLAN/802.11 connection evne though it uses the same band. Finally after lot of trial and error, I figured out that doing the following things reduced the noise down to a bare minimum (in fact zero):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Use Channel 9 on the wi-fi router for 2.4GHz band with band width being 20MHz&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Keep the transmitter away from PS3&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Keep the transmitter away from the TV (It&amp;rsquo;s surprising how much the EMI emitting from those huge LCDs can affect wireless performance.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now, it&amp;rsquo;s working awesomely and I just had a decent run of the missing link DLC of Deus Ex HR :)&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Fixing the DS3/Sixaxis Controller Not Working in PSN Store Issue</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2013/01/13/fixing-the-ds3sixaxis-controller-not-working-in-psn-store-issue/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jan 2013 19:55:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2013/01/13/fixing-the-ds3sixaxis-controller-not-working-in-psn-store-issue/</guid><description>&lt;p>So, my wife got me a new slim PS3 today to replace my old YLOD&amp;rsquo;ed phat (Yes, Awesome wife I know. And slim PS3 cuz I hate the looks of the new superslim). But, I digress. The issue at hand is that everything worked fine when I unwrapped it, hooked it up to the power and TV and switched it on. However, once I started the PSN store (or what is now called Sony Entertainment Network Store), nothing worked. I got the main screen/content of the store displayed but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t move around in the store. None of the buttons on the DS3 worked. I hooked up my older sixaxis and still the same. The only thing I could do was to hit the PS button which would bring up a menu from where I could quit the store app and then again everything worked fine once I was out onto XMB or in any game or for any other feature not related to the store.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>So, my wife got me a new slim PS3 today to replace my old YLOD&amp;rsquo;ed phat (Yes, Awesome wife I know.

&lt;p>Using different controllers made sure that it was not a controller issue. I suspected that it could be a bad coding issue on Sony&amp;rsquo;s part where the store is trying to communicate over some ports and the thread blocks on not being able to (since I had the router firewall on and UPnP disabled) making it look like the controller isn&amp;rsquo;t working. So, I turned on UPnP and rebooted the router but still the same issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, ultimately I hit upon the solution by mistake. I kept a button pressed on the controller while the PSN store was starting up and there it was. I could now move around and use the store without any issues. So, that&amp;rsquo;s the solution folks. Just keep a button pressed before starting the store app and keep it pressed till the main screen is fully loaded. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how or why this fixes the problem and I&amp;rsquo;m going to drop a mail to the Sony customer care after writing this blog post. I hope they fix this in the next update.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Featured in Chip India August 2011 Edition</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2011/08/01/featured-in-chip-india-august-2011-edition/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2011 03:24:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2011/08/01/featured-in-chip-india-august-2011-edition/</guid><description>&lt;p>My project &lt;a href="http://tech.shantanugoel.com/2011/03/20/making-kinect-work-with-ps3.html">Kinect on PS3&lt;/a> got featured in this month&amp;rsquo;s Chip magazine :).

&lt;p>Now, of course, kinect doesn&amp;rsquo;t work with PS3 obviously but then if we can&amp;rsquo;t break the rules, we can at least bend them a little towards our way. I&amp;rsquo;ve  created a mashup that allows you to use kinect as an input controller for the PS3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Please note that this is pre-alpha quality software currently&lt;/strong>. I haven&amp;rsquo;t updated to a lot of recent code for the below libraries and also haven&amp;rsquo;t done most of the performance/feature improvements yet. The axis performance specially needs lot of tweaking and it works well only while sitting. Putting this out purely as a proof of concept. For the things that I plan to add soon, please see the Todo section below. Follow me at &lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/shantanugoel">@shantanugoel&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> for latest updates.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The program makes use of several other programs in order to provide this functionality. To compile/use it, you also need the following programs:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenNI/OpenNI">OpenNI Libraries&lt;/a> - To get data from kinect&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.openni.org/downloadfiles/">NITE Libraries&lt;/a> (Choose &amp;ldquo;Middleware&amp;rdquo; on the page) - Builds on top of OpenNI to provide gesture detection etc&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/boilerbots/Sensor">PrimeSense Libraries for kinect&lt;/a> - Kinect drivers to get raw data&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/diyps3controller/">DIYPS3Controller&lt;/a> - The main component for PS3 connection and also known as sixaxis emulator. This emulates a DS3 on the PC and send the inputs to PS3 through bluetooth.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Installation/Compilation/Usage&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Make sure that the above 4 things are installed on your machine and working fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Download the source of this project to the NITE Samples directory. You can even place it anywhere else but you would need to tweak the makefile to account for the changed paths.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Make any changes to the source that you need.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Change the included ps3 controller config xml file and place it in one of the locations where diyps3controller can find it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Run make -f kinect-ps3.mak&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The executable will be available in Samples/Bin directory of NITE.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Run kinect-ps3 (without any arguments)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Run emuclient (from ps3 controller software) and choose the new xml config file&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Become the controller&amp;rdquo; :)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Default Config&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Menu Profile - This is the default profile that kinect-ps3 starts with and allows to operate the PS3 menus. Moving hand in any direction will move the ps3 menus as if you were using the DPAD with those directions keys pressed. If you run out of the kinect&amp;rsquo;s watched space, then just do a backward push with your hand, bring your hand to center and then again do the backward push and continue scrolling. This is like you lift your finger up and then start dragging from edges of a laptop&amp;rsquo;s touchpad.For selecting any item, make two successive push movements with your hand without changing any x-y direction.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Game Profile - This profile can be switched to by doing 3 successive backward movements of the hand while in Menu profile. Right now I&amp;rsquo;ve implemented only directional controls in game profile because I&amp;rsquo;m still struggling with multiple hands detections and skeletal tracking. A full profile will be activated soon enough. Currently, the your hand&amp;rsquo;s x/y movements and directly translated to right stick x/y movements (e.g. this is looking in different directions in various FPS games). Moving the hand towards or away from kinect (z-axis) translate to left stick y movements (e.g. this is moving fowards or backwards in most FPS games).

&lt;li>
&lt;p>Skeletal tracking for better game profiles&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Switching back to menu profiles from game profiles&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Easier way to specify user custom profiles instead of changing code for the same&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Performance improvement for game profiles&lt;/p>

And yeah, do not hesitate to point out the flaws if any and I&amp;rsquo;d also love to hear about the tactics that you follow as well as KZ2 is a game where the element of surprise is very important which calls for unusual strategies many times ;).&lt;br>
So without wasting any more time, here is a really really basic set that you should follow:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Engineer&amp;rsquo;s Prime Role:&lt;/strong> Understand that your role is not that of a front line assault. An engineer is best suited as a defender or a support class.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Engineer&amp;rsquo;s Weapon - Shotgun&lt;/strong>: The shotgun is called the one shot killer. It fires a burst of various pellets resulting in a much larger hit area and so you need not be extremely accurate. But it has some salient points to be noted while using it.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Shotgun is useful only in a very short range. Avoid long range combat because 99% you will find yourself dead without even getting a single hit point at the opponent. This means lurk around in corners or alleyways, take the less travelled routes to your destinations, and let your turrets do the most of your job for you&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Shotgun is slightly heavy as compared to other weapons and hence you will find yourself moving that right analog stick quite a bit more for aiming.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Shotgun has a high reload time between bullets and especially the full magazine. So if you are in middle of a fight and run out of a mag, it&amp;rsquo;s best to take out your M4 revolver instead of waiting to reload (or just run away if you are not confident enough of your revolver or haven&amp;rsquo;t unlocked it yet)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Engineer&amp;rsquo;s Primary Ability - Turrets&lt;/strong>:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Find elevated places. It has two advantages. First, it is more difficult for the opposition to take it out because it is above the eye level and second, your turret has more chances of getting headshots leading to faster kills and more points.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cover up alleyways/alternate routes which the enemy can take to flank your team. This is more important than you think. You are, in effect, forcing the opposition to take a route where most of your team mates can easily take them down.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t place them close to walls as it makes them more susceptible to damage.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t bunch up your turrets, keep them a safe distance apart. This has two advantages. First, it is more difficult for the enemy to take out your turrets (otherwise they can take them out together easily), plus each turret can give cover to the other and also attack the enemy from two sides taking him down quickly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For rounds like Search &amp;amp; Destroy/ Defend or assassination, don&amp;rsquo;t place turrets very close to the objective point but at a slight distance, at a place where the turret has clear line of sight to the objective point and/or the path to it. This will make it safe from the enemy while raining hell onto him while he is concentrating somewhere else.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Engineer&amp;rsquo;s Secondary Ability - Repair&lt;/strong>:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Repair ability is a very underrated ability. It might not give you a hell lot of points by itself but it is very important for your team.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Repairing ammo crates is a natural thing as your team mates might need it but that is not the most important thing to concentrate upon as people might not need them too often as people die often in KZ2 and moreover they might not want to waste time taking stuff out of the crate and risking their life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>First important use of repair ability is to repair your own turrets. Your turrets go under wear and tear as time progresses or when attacked by someone. It is of utmost importance to keep repairing them because you have to wait for a lot of time before you can set up another turret while repair ability recharges much faster.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Second is to repair the emplaced/mounted machine guns at various places in the maps. Repair them and use them to take down the enemy quickly (especially useful for S&amp;amp;D). But make sure that another guy/turret is protecting you from out of peripheral-view attacks.
So that&amp;rsquo;s it for now. But keep in mind that just reading these tips won&amp;rsquo;t help unless you &lt;strong>practice.&lt;/strong> Let me know if you found these tips helpful or if you have any map/situation specific queries and if you would like to add your own strategies. I&amp;rsquo;ll take up a new class next time.&lt;/li>

As soon as there was an outage, it couldn’t stop the PS3 from an abrupt shut down. I ran around the pathetic Microtek customer service for days and they finally sent an “engineer” down to my place (after a week) to diagnose the issue and he couldn’t say anything more than that the UPS is meant for a PC and nothing else. All logical discussions to tell him that PS3 is essentially a PC but in a different form were kind of like pouring water on a well-oiled rock and hoping it would stick.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>I got myself a &lt;strong>Microtek 800VA UPS (MDP800+)&lt;/strong> a couple of weeks ago to save my PS3 from the frequent power outages that we are seeing in Hyderabad but the purpose was rather lost when I found that it worked fine only till the mains power was on.

&lt;p>Kind of disappointed, I had a hunch which solved it for me though today :). When I tried to read the output voltage from the output ports on the UPS, it showed me 225–230V when main supply was on. As soon as it was switched off, the output dropped to around 160V. On connecting the PS3, it went up a bit (to around 180V). Now, the load should not have been an issue because a PS3 requires 180–350W I think, which can easily be given by even a 500VA UPS. So far, all suggestions given to me were to remove everything else from the UPS except the PS3, but that was actually my setup in the very first place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The weird idea that I had was that the problem is, in fact, that the PS3 is not enough load for it. Call me crazy but as soon as I connected my TV also to the UPS, it started working just fine and dandy. No trip ups now, and I can even cold-boot my PS3 and TV from the UPS backup alone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, I ain’t the sharpest tool in the shed when it comes to electrical stuff (in fact this was one of my most dreaded subjects during my graduation). So, if anyone can give me a sound reasoning behind what I just saw would be very much appreciated. Or is this a real fault with the unit that I got, or maybe it is a defect in all the Microtek UPS’s? Anyways, I ain’t complaining till it’s working for me :) and if you are seeing the same issues you could try the same as well.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
