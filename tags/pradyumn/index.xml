I wasn&amp;rsquo;t so sure about it in the beginning since I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to force my career choices or interests on to him. But I realized that he wanted to do it of his own accord, so I agreed to help him. But our deal was that I will introduce him a bit to the learning resources and help him out with his doubts here and there, while he will peruse all the learning material and build his things on his own without much interference/interaction with me.</description></item></channel></rss>
