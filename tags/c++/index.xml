My attempts so far have been ameturish, as I&amp;rsquo;ve never had a formal CS course, and this looked useful to upskill my toolkit. However, the book implements the interpreter in Java (at least the first part, which I am going through now) and I&amp;rsquo;m trying to follow along in C++ instead since I don&amp;rsquo;t have much experience in Java, neither an inclination to learn it.</description></item></channel></rss>
