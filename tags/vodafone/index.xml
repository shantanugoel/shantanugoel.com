&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>iPhone&lt;/strong>: The big icon. Bharti Airtel/Vodafone claimed lakhs of pre-registrations, yet no one lined up to buy it. Anyways, to the point. The ads all over the print, digital and broadcast media in India list out 3 major points in one sentence:&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="http://www.mobileburn.com/news.jsp?Id=5176">UK Ad Authorities have declared iPhone ad as &amp;ldquo;misleading&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/a> I guess then they should declare it plain fraud in India.&lt;/p>

&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>1. **A 3G Phone:** My a$$. They haven't even finalized auction details for 3G spectrum in India yet.
2. **Desktop Class Browser:** Without Flash?
3. **Push E-mail:** Oh, the one that Apple already pulled the plug on?
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Anyways, even if this were to be true, nobody would have bought it for the steep price for something that hardly even performs properly as a phone.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>BIG TV&lt;/strong>: This is the &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; big one, from the stable of none other than Reliance/Anil Dhirubhai Ambani. Ok, it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be good, very good. I checked out &lt;a href="http://bigtv.co.in">their website&lt;/a> to see how good. What do I get?&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>1. A flash only site. No fallback. Did they get it coded from a high-school flash junkie?
2. After 15 minutes of looking around clicking on 10s of links, going in circles, I'm still confused. What exactly are their packages. There are so many rates and offers floating around. Everything promising something different, but wait, not available for your region. There are so many channels, more than your current DTH, but one second, WHAT exactly are thos channels. No list? For all I care, they could be endless streams of Doordarshan and ETV regional ones. (Please repeat the question I asked in point 1 here again)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Makes me wonder, do they really want to sell anything or Anil just made this out for fun, having a roaring time watching realtime website logs seeing people getting stuck and frustrated in the maze.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>SmartPhones/NextGen Telephony: News That Matters</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/14/smartphonesnextgen-telephony-news-that-matters/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Feb 2008 05:08:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/14/smartphonesnextgen-telephony-news-that-matters/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just wanted to share some pieces that generated a variety of &amp;ldquo;hmmm&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;ahaa&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;wow&amp;rdquo; from me:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.telstra.com.au/abouttelstra/media/announcements_article.cfm?ObjectID=41758">Telstra Launches the i-mate Ultimate 8502 and 9502 in Australia&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Telstra and i-mate have today launched the i-mate™ Ultimate 8502 and i-mate™ Ultimate 9502. Telstra is the first operator to deploy these devices globally and both devices will be exclusive in Australia to Telstra customers. Building on a five-year partnership which has seen the successful launch of 10 i-mate™ devices on the Telstra network, Telstra has teamed up with i-mate™ again to release the Ultimate mobile devices.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;AHA&amp;rdquo; - So, they are not vaporware after all :) !!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2008/02/android-sdk-m5-rc14-now-available.html">Android SDK m5-rc14 now available&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>New user interface&lt;/strong> - As I mentioned when we introduced the m3 version of the Android SDK, we&amp;rsquo;re continuing to refine the UI that&amp;rsquo;s available for Android. m5-rc14 replaces the previous placeholder with a new UI, but as before, work on it is still in-progress.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Layout animations&lt;/strong> - Developers can now create layout animations for their applications using the capabilities introduced in the android.view.animation package. Check out the LayoutAnimation*.java files in the APIDemos sample code for examples of how this works.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Geo-coding&lt;/strong> - android.location.Geocoder enables developers to forward and reverse geo-code (i.e. translate an address into a coordinate and vice-versa), and also search for businesses.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>New media codecs&lt;/strong> - The MediaPlayer class has added support for the OGG Vorbis, MIDI, XMF, iMelody, RTTL/RTX, and OTA audio file formats.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Updated Eclipse plug-in&lt;/strong> - A new version of ADT is available and provides improvements to the Android developer experience. In particular, check out the new Android Manifest editor.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;WOW&amp;rdquo; What else can I say?!!&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
