You could use screensavers, movies and what not as your desktop background. This update fixes a segfault that many users were facing, a new debug option to print some debug mesages to get some info if it is not working for you and a new hack option for giving a &amp;ldquo;desktop window&amp;rdquo; name to the program. On many systems, the desktop is drawn by another program. e.g. in Ubuntu with Gnome environment, the desktop is managed by Nautilus, which creates a special window called &amp;ldquo;Desktop&amp;rdquo; and places it over your real desktop. This window name can be different in different systems. To find out what is yours, just run &amp;ldquo;xwininfo&amp;rdquo; in a terminal. Your cursor will become a &amp;ldquo;+&amp;rdquo; sign. Click anywhere on an empty area on your desktop, which will give you the window name of the transparent window, if any, that is covering your desktop. Pass this info to xwinwrap using the option &amp;ldquo;-d windowname&amp;rdquo; and it would help it to run better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As usual, 32 bit as well as 64 bit binary files are available as downloads. For users of Debian and derived operating systems (like Ubuntu, Mepis, etc), deb packages are also included for both architectures for easy installation. Source code is also available, of course.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Project: Shantz-XwinWrap Updated to 0.02</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/10/18/project-shantz-xwinwrap-updated-to-002/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Oct 2008 11:03:48 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/10/18/project-shantz-xwinwrap-updated-to-002/</guid><description>As some of you know that I&amp;rsquo;ve taken up the development of the ultra-cool xwinwrap tool that allows you to use movies, screensavers etc as wallpapers for you linux desktops.

&lt;p>Seeing no-one picking it up, I decided to give it a bit of polish last weekend by fixing the above problems and also add a few features.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope to continue on the good work that was done by the original author and provide an even better xwinwrap to you all. Pour in those ideas about what features you&amp;rsquo;d like to see in this.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Shantz XWinWrap</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/09/03/shantz-xwinwrap/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2008 14:41:44 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/09/03/shantz-xwinwrap/</guid><description>XWinWrap is a small utility written a loooong time ago that allowed you to stick most of the apps to your desktop background.

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Well, sticking didn&amp;rsquo;t work. So if you did a &amp;ldquo;minimize all&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;go to desktop&amp;rdquo; kind of thing, your &amp;ldquo;wallpaper&amp;rdquo; got minimized as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The geometry option didn&amp;rsquo;t work, so you could not create, e.g., a small matrix window surrounded by your original wallpaper.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Seeing no-one picking it up, I decided to give it a bit of polish last weekend by fixing the above problems and also add a few features. And here it is, in its new avatar &amp;ldquo;Shantz XWinWrap&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Video:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Usage&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The download file above contains 32 bit as well as 64 bit binaries. (Deb packages for ubuntu/debian are also included in the same file)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Though a lot of options are shown below, the only ones you&amp;rsquo;d most likely need are &amp;ldquo;fs&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;g&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;ov&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sh&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The modified source code can be browsed/downloaded from the &lt;a href="https://launchpad.net/xwinwrap">Shantz XWinWrap Launchpad Bzr repository&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>ChangeLog:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>15-Feb-2009:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Fixed the bug where XFetchName returning a NULL for &amp;ldquo;name&amp;rdquo; resulted in a crash. Props to Kevin&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Provided an option to specify the desktop window name.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Added Debug messages.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>18-Oct-2008:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Fixed a bug where the generated window overlapped other windows.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>28-Aug-2008:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Fixed &amp;ldquo;sticky&amp;rdquo;, now it sticks like a true wallpaper to your desktop.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Fixed &amp;ldquo;geometry&amp;rdquo; option. Now you can create smaller windows and draw/position them anywhere on your screen.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Added non-rectangular shaped windows option. Now, you can create circular or triangular windows with xwinwrap to get that cool effect.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol></content></item></channel></rss>
