I&amp;rsquo;ll be one of the proud owners of a very special steel book edition of Killzone 2 very soon.

And the icing on the cake &amp;ldquo;A free classic Art Book&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>My Brief History With Computers</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/06/23/my-brief-history-with-computers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2008 14:30:00 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/06/23/my-brief-history-with-computers/</guid><description>I’m going to be bespectacled and have been advised to reduce and limit my computer usage considerably.

Well, if you dream about conversing like this, then you are better off playing something like COD4 or BF2, but if you are into a little bit less intense military warfare, and are a fan of games like worms, tanks, etc (I&amp;rsquo;m a convicted Worms World Party addict on my HTC Wizard) then you are in for countless fun-filled, sleepless nights.</description></item><item><title>AMD (ATi) Step Up The Tempo</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/01/28/amd-ati-step-up-the-tempo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jan 2008 16:01:45 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/01/28/amd-ati-step-up-the-tempo/</guid><description>AMD has been taking a lot of flak lately in its processor business, and a similar (albeit milder) thrashing was being given to its ATi Gfx line up as well.
