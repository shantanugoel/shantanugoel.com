Whatever maybe the reason, the main point is that because of this hard disk, now we cannot just turn off the power of the router any more. It has to be shut down gracefully like a PC. One way is to ssh/telnet to it and then give the &amp;ldquo;halt&amp;rdquo; command but then you have to switch on a PC specially just to turn off your router. Well not any more.
