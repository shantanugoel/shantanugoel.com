&lt;p>You should not upgrade to Ubuntu 9.04 (aka Jaunty Jackalope), released a few weeks ago, if:&lt;/p>

&lt;li>
&lt;p>You have an older ATI graphics card (prior to R500, .e.g xpress 200m)&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update: It has come to my notice that many people do not know about this (and other problems listed in comments of this post).

&lt;p>You should not upgrade to Ubuntu 9.04 (aka Jaunty Jackalope), released a few weeks ago, if:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You have an older ATI graphics card (prior to R500, .e.g xpress 200m)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You like to have 3D support (read compiz/games, etc)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This is because of the following reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Ubuntu Jaunty Jackalope has the new version of X.org server (1.6)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The open source graphics drivers for ATI do not have 3D support&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The only version of the ATI properietary drivers (fglrx\Catalyst) compatible with X.org server 1.6 is 9.4&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Support for older cards (mentioned above) was dropped from fglrx 9.4&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So, basically right now you are in a soup and it seems to me that this is going to remain this way unless someone figures out how to backport x.org 1.5 onto Jauntu, which is going to be a hell of a task, IMHO :P&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, if you are a simple person, who looks beyond the gloss of the 3D and marvels at the beauty that the rest of the system holds, then go right ahead and dive in :)&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>All Your Base Are Belong To Us - Says Dell</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/01/30/all-your-base-are-belong-to-us-says-dell/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jan 2008 18:27:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/01/30/all-your-base-are-belong-to-us-says-dell/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/dell_8800.jpg" alt="Dell_8800">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ask any laptop user about how much he liked to kick some butt in Gears of War and he would cringe and cry with agony even before you are able to say the &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rdquo; of Crysis. But not anymore. For its notebook consumers, Dell has finally come up with the &lt;a href="http://direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2008/01/29/43163.aspx">perfect answer&lt;/a> to the questions posed by these ridiculously-difficult-to-get-more-than-10-fps games. Available now is some motherly love for your laps in the form of &lt;a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/geforce_8800m.html">8800M GTX &lt;/a>with its M1730. But that&amp;rsquo;s not all, it slaps onto the lappy not one, but two GFX cards in one. Yes, men, you heard that right &amp;ldquo;SLI&amp;rdquo; &lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/smile1.gif" alt="">.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/dell_8800.jpg" alt="Dell_8800">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>And those who are just beginning to get those puddles forming around the corners of their eyes because they bought their M1730&amp;rsquo;s with the slightly retro 8700&amp;rsquo;s, Dell loves you as well, because you, my dear friends, get an option to upgrade to the latest and greatest as well (US only as of now, but would soon be offered to Europe, AP customers as well).&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
