I tried all possible means, like putting it on a different server, installing from local disk, changing versions, deleting all cache, etc but still the issue persisted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally looking into the source code of the chromium browser svn repository, I got a clue. What google chrome does when you install a script as installation is that it first downloads the script, then it calls a function ConvertUserScriptToExtension to convert the script into a google chrome compatible script and then installs it. Now, since I had already installed this script once, I found that the script was already existing in my downloads directory, so while downloading chrome renames it to &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->(1).js (i.e., appends a number to it to distinguish from the original file). But it seems like that the path sent to the conversion function still uses the original name/path and it somehow finds that the older file is not the downloaded one but also doesn&amp;rsquo;t know which is the current downloaded one and hence fails with an error &amp;ldquo;Could not read source file&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Solution: Pretty simple. Just delete the original file present in your download directory and then try installing the script and it will install fine :)&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
