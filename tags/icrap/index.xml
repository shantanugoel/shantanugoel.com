&lt;p>I also “admire” Nokia because of the quality and reliability they provide with their phones. Having worked for them in a project (Nokia Networks/Nokia Seimens Networks actually), I know how much testing they put in before releasing something. That coupled with the recent &lt;a href="/2008/01/28/htc-the-best-windows-mobile-business-unit.html">crap-doings&lt;/a> by even the largest of the WM Phone companies like HTC, have made me try to look elsewhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, if this &lt;a href="http://www.itwire.com/content/view/16510/127/">news&lt;/a> comes true, then we are in for a treat, as the two giants might just come together to give us a sweet little toy for our “smart” cravings &lt;img src="/img/uploads/smile3.gif" alt="">. Read the news and let us know how you feel about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PS: Don’t even mention iPhone/iPod/iTouch or any other iCrap.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
