The experience during the commute daily was underwhelming. Couple the spotty airtel data connection with no one station covering all songs I would love and it makes for a frustrating commute with long gaps all over. Slacker has a radio station caching feature but unfortunately doesn&amp;rsquo;t support India. So I took things into my own hands and Shoutcast2Dropbox was born this weekend. Details follow below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Link:Â &lt;a href="https://github.com/shantanugoel/Shoutcast2Dropbox">https://github.com/shantanugoel/Shoutcast2Dropbox&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="shoutcast2dropbox---automatic-shoutcast-stations-to-dropbox-recorder">&lt;strong>Shoutcast2Dropbox - Automatic Shoutcast Stations To Dropbox Recorder&lt;/strong>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This simple script allows to automatically download a specified duration of song collections from different shoutcast stations and then automatically upload them to your dropbox. This can be used to create your own station caching feature with a variety of benefits:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Individual songs instead of one lengthy stream so you can skip forward/backwards among them&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mix up a variety of different stations instead of listening to a single type (e.g. I mix up different types of rock and metal stations with a few latest hits ones thrown in)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No buffering/precious mobile data usage as the Dropbox folder can be synced to phone on wifi (I use Dropsync to schedule syncs on home wifi)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>New playlist every day instead of listening to same old stored songs&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I created this for myself one day as I was sick of the many issues that plague streaming music (the ones listed above that are overcome with this script). It may have bugs or may not cover all usecases. I&amp;rsquo;d love to get feedback to fix the bugs and add more features, so feel free to send in your requests.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="dependencies">&lt;strong>Dependencies&lt;/strong>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>For the script:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Linux Host - (PC/Router/Raspberry Pi/Server etc). Script is written for shell currently but may be adapted for windows. I run it on my router as a cronjob.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>streamripper - Opensource Shoutcast recorder program&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dropbox Uploader - For Dropbox sync. Linked as submodule in this git repository.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h1 id="usage">&lt;strong>Usage&lt;/strong>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Once above dependencies are satisfied, run the Dropbox Uploader script and do the steps as mentioned to create a folder for syncing the songs to your Dropbox.
After that, you can run the Shoutcast2Dropbox script as below:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>./Shoutcast2Dropbox.sh &amp;lt;Input File for station lists&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Cumulative Duration to record in seconds&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Output Directory path&amp;gt; &lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Input file should have 1 station url per line. An example file (stations-example.txt) is given in this repository
Duration in seconds is split up into equal durations for each station. e.g. 3600 seconds (1 hour) given here with a station list of 3 means each station will be recorded for 1200 seconds (or 20 minutes).
Output directory is where the songs will be captured to.
Example:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>./Shoutcast2Dropbox.sh stations-example.txt 3600 /home/Shantanu/songs &lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sync the folder to your phone (See tips section ;) )&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="tips">&lt;strong>Tips&lt;/strong>&lt;/h1>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Station urls are not the website urls. You need to get their actual shoutcast stream urls. If they are not present on the website in plain view, generally you can &amp;ldquo;inspect&amp;rdquo; the web page or view source to find those out.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Use aac streams if possible. They are lower size and higher quality compared to mp3s&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Instead of running the script manually, set it up as a cron job to run automatically. I set it up to run every day around noon (so that songs get downloaded by the time I reach home)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Set it up on a low power device which is always on. e.g. I set it up on my router.
i) I had to install a few extras on my router for this to work (e.g. coreutils-stat pkg from entware). You may need to do so as well
ii) I used -k option in script for Dropbox Uploader due to missing ca certificates. You may either choose to install certificates (not a problem on PC but slightly involved on router) or use -k option wherever dropbox uploader commands are used. Didn&amp;rsquo;t check in the k option to avoid security issues by default.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>For listening to fresh playlists every day while on the road with least effort, setup your phone to automatically sync this. I use &amp;ldquo;DropSync&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Tasker&amp;rdquo; for this. DropSync allows to sync any dropbox folder to the phone and tasker automates this process while taking care of not disturbing your normal phone use. I set it up like this:
a. Setup DropSync to do only manual sync.
b. In Tasker, create a profile with this conditions:
i) An hourly repeating time event from 10 PM to 6 AM
ii) Wifi is connected instead of mobile data
iii) Location context is home (from another of my profiles. You can instead choose to use your specific home wifi ssid in above step)
iv) Phone is getting charged (so that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t lose power in the middle)
c. Profile enter task is setup to check a variable if sync is done or not. If not done, then trigger the sync and then set the sync done variable.
d. Profile exit task is setup to clear the sync done variable for next day.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol></content></item><item><title>Converting A Toy RC Car Into An Autonomous Fun Car The Indian Way</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2014/07/23/converting-a-toy-rc-car-into-an-autonomous-fun-car-the-indian-way/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2014 17:05:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2014/07/23/converting-a-toy-rc-car-into-an-autonomous-fun-car-the-indian-way/</guid><description>&lt;p>Dangerous is a mind which is left grounded at home for days.

A little bit of research told me that this was because the post contained some words that were considered harmful by the &amp;ldquo;mod_security&amp;rdquo; plugin for apache that had been installed by my host to prevent hacking attempts. The quick resolution was to include the following lines in my .htaccess:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&amp;lt;ifmodule mod_security.c&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>SecFilterEngine Off
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>SecFilterScanPOST Off
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&amp;lt;/ifmodule&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Sure enough, I put them in, published the post, and it worked. But since this meant opening up my site to the real hacking attempts, I commented them out and went about my work, occassionally turning them on as and when required.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, a few days ago, after a server upgrade, the problem reared its head again, and in a more vicious manner. I started getting the dreaded 406 error again, and this time for any post, even a blank post, and through all clients. But this time, TinyMCE was working without issues. A little bit of looking around my site told me that the problem was that my desktop clients were not able to connect to my &amp;ldquo;x mlrpc.php&amp;rdquo; file which is responsible for taking care of all the remote api provided by WordPress. Trying to access it through any means provided the 406 error. My site&amp;rsquo;s error log was filled with:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>An appropriate representation of the requested resource /x mlrpc.php could not be found on this server.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Now, the xml rpc methods are used not just by WordPress but many other CMS&amp;rsquo;s (like drupal, joomla, etc) and sure enough a quick search resulted in many similar reports for all the platforms. Enabling my previous mod_security options resulted in &amp;ldquo;503: Server misconfiguration&amp;rdquo; errors, complicating things further.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On seeing the error logs, I found that the server could not understand the options, and then I discovered that the mod_security had been upgraded to and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t backward compatible with old options. Modifying the options to their latest counterparts also didn&amp;rsquo;t work, as further wading through mod_security manual told me that now, its options cannot be overridden through .htaccess and can only be changed by the web admin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I found that my host has basically blocked the x mlrpc.php file from being accessed at all instead of using proper rules for blocking only the attacks while allowing valid accesses. This was the problem that a huge number of people are also having and moreover they (like me) are not able to convince their hosts to switch to proper rules.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, not all hope is lost. I have &amp;ldquo;fixed&amp;rdquo; this issue with a workaround for now. It is pretty simple really. Just rename your x mlrpc.php to something else (e.g. myrpc123.php) and also replace all references to it in your CMS with your new file name. You can use sed to automate this task. I used perl however:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>perl -e 's/x mlrpc.php/myrpc123.php/gi' -p -i *&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, the 406 errors should be gone. If this worked for you, or you had any issues let me know. Also, if you have any other workarounds/fixes of your own, do drop me a word.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note:&lt;/strong> In the above article, please ignore the space between &amp;ldquo;x&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;mlrpc&amp;rdquo; as the mod_security rules prevent them from being in content also. Moreover, use some unique name for rpc file.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Hack:Disabling the Message Box In Oxios Memory Apps (Windows Mobile)</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/15/hackdisabling-the-message-box-in-oxios-memory-apps-windows-mobile/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2008 08:43:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/15/hackdisabling-the-message-box-in-oxios-memory-apps-windows-mobile/</guid><description>&lt;p>**Update: **Modified the &amp;ldquo;Oxios Hibernate&amp;rdquo; app as well on public demand. Please redownload the below mentioned package. It now has Oxios Close as well as Oxios Hibernate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oxios developed a very useful tool for Windows Mobile (WM2003/5/6/6.1) called &amp;ldquo;Oxios Memory&amp;rdquo; sometime ago. On running it, it&amp;rsquo;ll flush your RAM (kind of) and recover substantial amounts of memory that can be used by the currently program. It is so good at this that many people run it regularly on their phones, and most of them want to run it in an automated mode (through a scheduler or a script). But the problem (so far) was that it generates a Message Box at the end for which the user has to press &amp;ldquo;OK&amp;rdquo; button to make it go away. There is no known way of disabling this message box and many attempts to work around it by scripting the &amp;ldquo;press OK&amp;rdquo; action have been very unreliable at best. Hence, it took it upon me today to remove this nagging problem and 5 minutes later we have a &amp;ldquo;clean&amp;rdquo; Oxios Memory.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>**Update: **Modified the &amp;ldquo;Oxios Hibernate&amp;rdquo; app as well on public demand.

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The issue here is that the code highlighting plugins use the &amp;ldquo;exact&amp;rdquo; text entered within the [ code ] (or similar) tags, and since we used the WYSIWYG/visual editors, they add html formatting tags to the code and also convert some special characters into HTML entities (e.g. &amp;gt; into &amp;gt;, &amp;lt; into &amp;lt;, white space into Â , etc).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The workaround is that you can write the code in html editing mode. But the problem here is that if you happen to switch to the visual mode or edit your post in this mode any time later, the problem will come back which makes editing posts a pain. So, here is a simple hack that will let you write your code in visual/WYSIWYG mode without doing anything special.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Note: **Although this hack is for &lt;a href="http://blog.igeek.info/still-fresh/2006/02/25/code-for-fun/">iG:Synatx Highlighter&lt;/a> plugin, but it can be added similarly to other plugins as well.&lt;/p>

&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-php" data-lang="php">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$arrSearch &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">array&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;lt; &amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;amp;lt; &amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34; &amp;gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34; &amp;amp;gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;lt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;amp;lt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$arrReplace &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">array&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;lt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;amp;lt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;lt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;amp;lt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$inTxt &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">str_replace&lt;/span>($arrSearch, $arrReplace, $inTxt);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Step 3) At the same place (from where you deleted the lines), add the following lines:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-php" data-lang="php">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$inTxt &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">strip_tags&lt;/span>($inTxt);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">if&lt;/span> (&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">PHP_VERSION&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;gt;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">5.0&lt;/span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> $inTxt &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">html_entity_decode&lt;/span>($inTxt, &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">ENT_QUOTES&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;UTF-8&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">else&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> $arrSearch &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">array&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;amp;lt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;amp;amp;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> $arrReplace &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">array&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;lt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34; &amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;amp;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> $inTxt &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">str_replace&lt;/span>($arrSearch, $arrReplace, $inTxt);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Step 4) Save the file. That&amp;rsquo;s it. You&amp;rsquo;re done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What we just did was strip out all the extraneous html formatting added by your editor and then convert the html entities into the characters that we want.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**IMPORTANT: **After this hack, you should write your code in visual mode. If you want to display some html code to your readers and write it in html mode of the editor then it might go boink. Otherwise it should be simple enough to create a new tag so that one set html editor code works and for another set, visual editor code works. But I would definitely recommend against it and anyways writing all code in visual mode, just like your other parts of your posts as its much more intuitive to write and easier to maintain and port to newer platforms.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Hack: WordPress function 'wp_list_pages' to output page description (or other custom fields) in your page lists</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/19/hack-wordpress-function-wp_list_pages-to-output-page-description-or-other-custom-fields-in-your-page-lists/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2008 03:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/19/hack-wordpress-function-wp_list_pages-to-output-page-description-or-other-custom-fields-in-your-page-lists/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Disclaimer:&lt;/strong> I&amp;rsquo;m neither a WordPress guru nor a PHP expert. This is what it is, a dirtly little hack, otherwise I&amp;rsquo;d have called it an &amp;ldquo;enhancement&amp;rdquo; &lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/smile1.gif" alt="Smile">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now onto the main things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Aim:&lt;/strong> You would have used wp_list_pages (or plugins like &lt;a href="http://www.dagondesign.com/articles/list-subpages-plugin-for-wordpress/">dd-list-subpages&lt;/a>, that use it) to display a list of your pages/subpages on a particular page. e.g., I use it on my &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://tech.shantanugoel.com/projects">Projects&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; pages hierarchy to list all the relevant projects under a particular heading. Now, the thing is that wp_list_pages gives you a lot of options to display things like dates, page title, page link, etc, but that&amp;rsquo;s not enough. I need to provide a small description for each page as well, to put things into perspective. Obviously, I don&amp;rsquo;t expect the visitors to go inside each link to see what it holds in store for them.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Disclaimer:&lt;/strong> I&amp;rsquo;m neither a WordPress guru nor a PHP expert.

I need to provide a small description for each page as well, to put things into perspective. Obviously, I don&amp;rsquo;t expect the visitors to go inside each link to see what it holds in store for them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Hack:&lt;/strong> What you need to do is locate a file called &amp;ldquo;classes.php&amp;rdquo; in your wordpress installation. It is usually located at &lt;code>&amp;lt;WordPress Base&amp;gt;/wp-includes&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, open the file and find a function called &amp;ldquo;start_el&amp;rdquo;. This is a function in the &amp;ldquo;Walker&amp;rdquo; class, which is used in WordPress to parse tree-like structures. Here, it used by wp_list_pages to list out all the pages. Now, at the very end of this function (just after the closing brace of if ( !empty($show_date) ) { ), place the following piece of code:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-php" data-lang="php">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$description &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">get_post_meta&lt;/span>($page&lt;span style="color:#f92672">-&amp;gt;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">ID&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;description&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">true&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">if&lt;/span> ($page&lt;span style="color:#f92672">-&amp;gt;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">ID&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">!=&lt;/span> $current_page)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> $output &lt;span style="color:#f92672">.=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/br&amp;gt; &amp;#34;&lt;/span>;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">if&lt;/span> (&lt;span style="color:#f92672">!&lt;/span>$description)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> $description &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">strip_tags&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">substr&lt;/span>($page&lt;span style="color:#f92672">-&amp;gt;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">post_content&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">0&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">250&lt;/span>));
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> $output &lt;span style="color:#f92672">.=&lt;/span> $description;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>What this code does is:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Look for a custom field called &amp;ldquo;description&amp;rdquo; in your pages. If present, it will show what you wrote there after each of your page in the list generated by wp_list_pages. (To add a custom field to your page, look at the very bottom of your &amp;ldquo;write&amp;rdquo; page or &amp;ldquo;manage&amp;rdquo; page in the WordPress dashboard.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If the &amp;ldquo;description&amp;rdquo; field is not present (obviously you might not like to go back and add a custom field to all your pages), it takes the first 250 characters of your page&amp;rsquo;s content and displays that.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Hack Is Not Finished Yet:&lt;/strong> There is just one little thing left to do. As I mentioned, this function is used other times as well (e.g. making your navigation menu). So, you don&amp;rsquo;t want the description to be appearing always, otherwise it will wreak havoc on your site&amp;rsquo;s layout. So, there is again a dirty little trick to prevent this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the place where you are calling wp_list_pages, modify the call to include the following code before and after the call:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-php" data-lang="php">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">update_option&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;my_wp_list_pages_option&amp;#39;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">1&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$content &lt;span style="color:#f92672">.=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">wp_list_pages&lt;/span>($your_wp_list_pages_options);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">update_option&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;my_wp_list_pages_option&amp;#39;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">0&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>And, modify the previously listed code as well to look like:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-php" data-lang="php">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$my_wp_list_pages_option &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">get_option&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;my_wp_list_pages_option&amp;#39;&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">if&lt;/span> ($my_wp_list_pages_option &lt;span style="color:#f92672">==&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">1&lt;/span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> $description &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">get_post_meta&lt;/span>($page&lt;span style="color:#f92672">-&amp;gt;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">ID&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;description&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">true&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">if&lt;/span> ($page&lt;span style="color:#f92672">-&amp;gt;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">ID&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">!=&lt;/span> $current_page)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> $output &lt;span style="color:#f92672">.=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/br&amp;gt; &amp;#34;&lt;/span>;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">if&lt;/span> (&lt;span style="color:#f92672">!&lt;/span>$description)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> $description &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">strip_tags&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">substr&lt;/span>($page&lt;span style="color:#f92672">-&amp;gt;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">post_content&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">0&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">250&lt;/span>));
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> $output &lt;span style="color:#f92672">.=&lt;/span> $description;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>What this does now is that it adds an option/variable to WordPress database, which you set to 1 before calling wp_list_pages to tell your code that now its time to display the description, and then restore its state to 0, to prevent the description from being displayed for any other wp_list_pages call.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Problem:&lt;/strong> Since the beginning of time (read launching of WM6), millions of WM users (ok ok, will not exaggerate from now on) have been facing a very peculiar issue. The issue is that people tell them all the time that they are avoiding those people, and not taking their calls. But as the perplexed WM&amp;rsquo;er flips through his calls log, he can&amp;rsquo;t find any sign of a missed call. Yes, the issue is that many times, the phone will go into a state where the caller will hear the ring go, there will be no sign on your phone of the same, not even a missed call. People all around the world have been after the solution with all their might, suggesting:&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/sherlock_small.jpg" alt="Sherlock">&lt;/p>

People all around the world have been after the solution with all their might, suggesting:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>To change over to Radio Rom x.xx.xx and swear it solved all their issues but we have had equal number of people in both camps (fixed and non-fixed) for every radio rom.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Various kinds of flashing techniques and orders but no concrete solution here either.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Standing on their heads and chanting &amp;ldquo;OM&amp;rdquo; for 10000 years (I&amp;rsquo;m at it again :))&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Anyways, the long and short of it is, they didn&amp;rsquo;t get anywhere. But worry no more, the messiah is here to save you all from social embarrassment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What To Expect:&lt;/strong> This will fix the missing call issue, plus on the phones I tested, the following issues were also fixed:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Signal strength meter remains stuck at whatever the strength was when the phone was booted.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The phone LCD turns on for no reason sometime.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I personally found the signal quality to be better. Previously I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to take/make any calls in my office cubicle but now I can.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A solution so simple, obvious and the fact that you already know it. :)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Disclaimer:&lt;/strong> Though I&amp;rsquo;ve promised you almost everything (except the kitchen sink), and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure that this should work for you (as I&amp;rsquo;ve tested this on three different HTC wizards, running different variations of WM6 ROMS), but still YMMV. (Just to save my skin from a disgruntled user who didn&amp;rsquo;t get it fixed and turned into a blood sucking psychopath, or even worse, a lawsuit-happy Jeff Thomson).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another thing to be noted is that if you use ActiveSync to sync with an exchange server, you&amp;rsquo;d probably not be able to solve your problems. Read on to find about it [Thnx to Alex, vboyz103 for reminding me to put it here]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Reasoning:&lt;/strong> Let me take you through my journey of discovering the solution to the problem. There are a lot of events that happened, many things I saw that led me to the solution:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Once I saw my phone light up for no reason and then after a few seconds I received a call on my landline saying I was not picking up my phone. I then tried calling up my phone again and again, every time I didn&amp;rsquo;t get any notification on my phone &amp;ldquo;except&amp;rdquo; a momentary flash up.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Another day I was tapping away at my keyboard, with my phone nearby. Then suddenly again there was a flash up, no call notification, BUT my speakers started humming, for a long time, i.e., as if in a call and not due to those momentary SDCCH transmissions. This meant that the radio ROM was indeed receiving the call, but somehow it could not notify the OS to tell me. &lt;em>Something was breaking the notification mechanism.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All times this happened, and I came to know, I checked to know what all tasks were running and somehow Active Sync was always there.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I tried killing active sync and then calling. Active Sync would be there again. But if I kill it and dont call, then it won&amp;rsquo;t be there. &lt;em>Hmmm..&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I had heard that switching off and flight mode solves this issue temporarily. I tried it. Flight mode could be switched on but was not able to switch off. That is my phone didn&amp;rsquo;t come back, &lt;strong>until&lt;/strong> I tried killing active sync and voila, phone could be turned on again.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Solution:&lt;/strong> Now, I was pretty sure that it had something to do with Active Sync. Another thing was I never had the missing calls issue, until this december when I switched to a new ROM. Was the new ROM bad? Couldn&amp;rsquo;t be because people had reported issues on earlier ROMs as well which I had used but never faced the problem. Then it suddenly dawned on me in zen-like-fashion. The legendary &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>Fake Server Trick&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;. In all my flashes, it was part of my initial rituals to do (along with the customary sacrificial goat) this but this time I had forgotten to. I immediately did it and when I reached the Active Sync schedule settings it was selected to &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>As Items Arrive&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;. Voila! I did the trick at a time when I was missing calls and immediately saw the results. Called from another phone and I got a ring! Somehow, it was eating up the notifications thinking they are some &amp;ldquo;items&amp;rdquo; meant for it. Since then, I tried it out on two more phones of friends with different WM6 ROMs and they havent seen the problem ever since, plus they got all the other benefits too as listed in &amp;ldquo;What to Expect&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Trick:&lt;/strong> Most of you who came here must be knowing the fake server trick, but if you don&amp;rsquo;t, then here it is:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Turn on your Device&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Go to Start &amp;gt; Programs &amp;gt; Activesync.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tap Menu at the bottom right hand corner of the screen.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tap on Add Server Source.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enter anything in all the boxes. Don&amp;rsquo;t need to go to any advanced options, etc. e.g. you can add &amp;ldquo;fake&amp;rdquo; in all options&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Go back into the Menu, and tap &amp;ldquo;Schedule&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Change both the Peak times and Off-peak times boxes to Manually.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Press the OK button at top-right.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You are done.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note:&lt;/strong> If you face any sync errors after doing this trick, then delete the config you just made for exchange and then try. Basically once you have done the schedule setting, you don&amp;rsquo;t require the exchange config anymore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Epilogue:&lt;/strong> Now, this has been working for me and my friends for the past few days. I deliberately delayed this post to be exactly sure. You are welcome to give me a simple thanks if it works for you. BUT if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t then also please let me know, may be we can debug it together.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
