With a sigh of relief I subscribed immediately and it was stellar at home with its wonderful 32 million song collection and chromecast support to boot. The experience during the commute daily was underwhelming. Couple the spotty airtel data connection with no one station covering all songs I would love and it makes for a frustrating commute with long gaps all over.</description></item><item><title>Converting A Toy RC Car Into An Autonomous Fun Car The Indian Way</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2014/07/23/converting-a-toy-rc-car-into-an-autonomous-fun-car-the-indian-way/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2014 17:05:12 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2014/07/23/converting-a-toy-rc-car-into-an-autonomous-fun-car-the-indian-way/</guid><description>Dangerous is a mind which is left grounded at home for days.

This router builds on the great lineage it has in its predecessors, the WL-500g, WL-500g Deluxe, WL-500gP, WL-500gP v2 etc, and shines ahead with being much more than a router, rather a complete headless linux PC. Anyways, to the point. In most routers/modems, if you forget the password to your web-administration gui (which generally resides as 192.</description></item><item><title>Http 406 Errors Galore</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/05/01/http-406-errors-galore/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2008 15:30:05 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/05/01/http-406-errors-galore/</guid><description>If you have ever had these errors or just want to be prepared in case they pop up somtime (and they surely will), then read on as I discuss various situations that lead to them and also their solutions.
I generally use desktop clients (mostly blogjet, but also Windows Live Writer and Scribe Fire sometimes) to blog to my WordPress based blogs. Some months ago, I started getting &amp;ldquo;Http 406: Not Acceptable&amp;rdquo; error while posting a particular post.</description></item><item><title>Hack:Disabling the Message Box In Oxios Memory Apps (Windows Mobile)</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/15/hackdisabling-the-message-box-in-oxios-memory-apps-windows-mobile/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2008 08:43:29 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/15/hackdisabling-the-message-box-in-oxios-memory-apps-windows-mobile/</guid><description>**Update: **Modified the &amp;ldquo;Oxios Hibernate&amp;rdquo; app as well on public demand. Please redownload the below mentioned package. It now has Oxios Close as well as Oxios Hibernate.
Oxios developed a very useful tool for Windows Mobile (WM2003/5/6/6.1) called &amp;ldquo;Oxios Memory&amp;rdquo; sometime ago. On running it, it&amp;rsquo;ll flush your RAM (kind of) and recover substantial amounts of memory that can be used by the currently program. It is so good at this that many people run it regularly on their phones, and most of them want to run it in an automated mode (through a scheduler or a script).</description></item><item><title>HACK: Fixing The Code Syntax Highlighter WordPress Plugins To Work With WYSIWYG</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/23/hack-fixing-the-code-syntax-highlighter-wordpress-plugins-to-work-with-wysiwyg/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2008 17:18:22 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/23/hack-fixing-the-code-syntax-highlighter-wordpress-plugins-to-work-with-wysiwyg/</guid><description>There are many code syntax highlighter plugins available for WordPress (e.g. iG Syntax Highlighter, WP-Syntax, etc) but almost all of them have a problem. They want you to write the code in &amp;ldquo;HTML editing mode&amp;rdquo;. If you use any kind of WYSIWYG or visual editors (like built in TinyMCE or offline clients&amp;rsquo; similar modes), there is a grave problem. Your code becomes garbled. e.g.:

This is what it is, a dirtly little hack, otherwise I&amp;rsquo;d have called it an &amp;ldquo;enhancement&amp;rdquo; Now onto the main things.
**Aim: **You would have used wp_list_pages (or plugins like dd-list-subpages, that use it) to display a list of your pages/subpages on a particular page. e.g., I use it on my &amp;ldquo;Projects&amp;rdquo; pages hierarchy to list all the relevant projects under a particular heading.</description></item><item><title>Windows Mobile 6 - Case of the Missing Calls: Solved</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/01/31/windows-mobile-6-case-of-the-missing-calls-solved/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jan 2008 18:30:33 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/01/31/windows-mobile-6-case-of-the-missing-calls-solved/</guid><description>As the pic above says, it turned out to be quite elementary in the end. But what is &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rdquo; actually?
The Problem: Since the beginning of time (read launching of WM6), millions of WM users (ok ok, will not exaggerate from now on) have been facing a very peculiar issue. The issue is that people tell them all the time that they are avoiding those people, and not taking their calls.</description></item></channel></rss>
