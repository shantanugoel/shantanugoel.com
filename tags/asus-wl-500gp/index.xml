This is especially important if you have a USB hard disk attached to it. There are many such scripts available in Oleg&amp;rsquo;s firmware that you can tweak. All of these reside in &amp;ldquo;/usr/local/sbin/&amp;rdquo;. The one that we are going to talk about today is named &amp;ldquo;pre-shutdown&amp;rdquo; and it is exceuted just before the router is about to shutdown. Here is my script that will stop all the programs that have been started, finalizes all data accesses for the hard drive, unmounts all the partitions and if they can&amp;rsquo;t be unmounted, then mounts them as read only to reduce the risks, and then allows the router to continue shutdown. Although this script is written for Asus WL-500W but it will work with most other routers that use oleg or unslung firmware (like Linksys NSLU2, Asus WL-500G, WL-500gP etc):&lt;/p>

But the media server that is included in the official firmware leaves a lot to be desired. If you are a fan of twonky, all you would have heard so far would have been that to use it on your router, you&amp;rsquo;d have to change your firmware over to a non-official one. If you do not want to take any risks with the custom firmwares, I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you a simple way to use twonky with the stock firmware itself. Follow these steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Download Twonky (The MIPS version) and extract/save it to some place on the harddisk attached to your router (e.g. /tmp/harddisk/part0/twonky/ )&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Create a new shell script for starting twonky automatically (Replace the paths according to where you stored the twonky files in step 1). All you need to do is create a text file with following contents and mark it as executable. We&amp;rsquo;ll name it init.sh.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">#!/bin/sh
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">&lt;/span>route add -net 224.0.0.0 netmask 240.0.0.0 dev br0
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>cd /tmp/harddisk/part0/twonky&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/br&amp;gt;/tmp/harddisk/part0/twonky/twonkymedia &amp;amp;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Copy this script to your harddisk to where you extracted twonky files.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Open up the router&amp;rsquo;s web administration page (most probably at 192.168.1.1), go to the USB section, and put the following line under &amp;ldquo;Initial Script&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>`/tmp/harddisk/part0/twonky/init.sh``&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="5">
&lt;li>Save, reboot and enjoy :)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>If you have any questions, let me know. Infact, the same tip can be used to install many other such softwares onto your Asus routers series including WL-500g, WL-500gP, WL-500W, etc.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>[TIP] Asus WL-500W Hacks:How To Reset Web Admin Password</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/01/23/tip-asus-wl-500w-hackshow-to-reset-web-admin-password/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2009 22:41:31 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/01/23/tip-asus-wl-500w-hackshow-to-reset-web-admin-password/</guid><description>Most of you must be knowing by now that I bought the amazing Asus WL-500W router a few days back.

This router builds on the great lineage it has in its predecessors, the WL-500g, WL-500g Deluxe, WL-500gP, WL-500gP v2 etc, and shines ahead with being much more than a router, rather a complete headless linux PC. Anyways, to the point. In most routers/modems, if you forget the password to your web-administration gui (which generally resides as 192.168.1.1), the only option left is to reset the router, thereby losing all your settings etc. But not so with this little beast. If you remember your ssh password (which BTW is available if you have installed a custom firmware on our router), then you can just login through it to your router and execute the following commands to save your skin:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>nvram get http_passwd&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This will display the current web administration password.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>nvram set http_passwd=&amp;quot;NewPasswd&amp;quot;&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This will set the new password. But remember that you have to enter another command (given below) to make sure that your new password is saved.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>nvram commit&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, just reboot and enjoy :)&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
