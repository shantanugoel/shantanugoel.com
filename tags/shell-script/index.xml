With a sigh of relief I subscribed immediately and it was stellar at home with its wonderful 32 million song collection and chromecast support to boot. The experience during the commute daily was underwhelming. Couple the spotty airtel data connection with no one station covering all songs I would love and it makes for a frustrating commute with long gaps all over. Slacker has a radio station caching feature but unfortunately doesn&amp;rsquo;t support India. So I took things into my own hands and Shoutcast2Dropbox was born this weekend. Details follow below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Link: &lt;a href="https://github.com/shantanugoel/Shoutcast2Dropbox">https://github.com/shantanugoel/Shoutcast2Dropbox&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="shoutcast2dropbox---automatic-shoutcast-stations-to-dropbox-recorder">&lt;strong>Shoutcast2Dropbox - Automatic Shoutcast Stations To Dropbox Recorder&lt;/strong>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This simple script allows to automatically download a specified duration of song collections from different shoutcast stations and then automatically upload them to your dropbox. This can be used to create your own station caching feature with a variety of benefits:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Individual songs instead of one lengthy stream so you can skip forward/backwards among them&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mix up a variety of different stations instead of listening to a single type (e.g. I mix up different types of rock and metal stations with a few latest hits ones thrown in)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No buffering/precious mobile data usage as the Dropbox folder can be synced to phone on wifi (I use Dropsync to schedule syncs on home wifi)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>New playlist every day instead of listening to same old stored songs&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I created this for myself one day as I was sick of the many issues that plague streaming music (the ones listed above that are overcome with this script). It may have bugs or may not cover all usecases. I&amp;rsquo;d love to get feedback to fix the bugs and add more features, so feel free to send in your requests.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="dependencies">&lt;strong>Dependencies&lt;/strong>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>For the script:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Linux Host - (PC/Router/Raspberry Pi/Server etc). Script is written for shell currently but may be adapted for windows. I run it on my router as a cronjob.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>streamripper - Opensource Shoutcast recorder program&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dropbox Uploader - For Dropbox sync. Linked as submodule in this git repository.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h1 id="usage">&lt;strong>Usage&lt;/strong>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Once above dependencies are satisfied, run the Dropbox Uploader script and do the steps as mentioned to create a folder for syncing the songs to your Dropbox.
After that, you can run the Shoutcast2Dropbox script as below:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>./Shoutcast2Dropbox.sh &amp;lt;Input File for station lists&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Cumulative Duration to record in seconds&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Output Directory path&amp;gt; &lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Input file should have 1 station url per line. An example file (stations-example.txt) is given in this repository
Duration in seconds is split up into equal durations for each station. e.g. 3600 seconds (1 hour) given here with a station list of 3 means each station will be recorded for 1200 seconds (or 20 minutes).
Output directory is where the songs will be captured to.
Example:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>./Shoutcast2Dropbox.sh stations-example.txt 3600 /home/Shantanu/songs &lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sync the folder to your phone (See tips section ;) )&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="tips">&lt;strong>Tips&lt;/strong>&lt;/h1>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Station urls are not the website urls. You need to get their actual shoutcast stream urls. If they are not present on the website in plain view, generally you can &amp;ldquo;inspect&amp;rdquo; the web page or view source to find those out.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Use aac streams if possible. They are lower size and higher quality compared to mp3s&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Instead of running the script manually, set it up as a cron job to run automatically. I set it up to run every day around noon (so that songs get downloaded by the time I reach home)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Set it up on a low power device which is always on. e.g. I set it up on my router.
i) I had to install a few extras on my router for this to work (e.g. coreutils-stat pkg from entware). You may need to do so as well
ii) I used -k option in script for Dropbox Uploader due to missing ca certificates. You may either choose to install certificates (not a problem on PC but slightly involved on router) or use -k option wherever dropbox uploader commands are used. Didn&amp;rsquo;t check in the k option to avoid security issues by default.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>For listening to fresh playlists every day while on the road with least effort, setup your phone to automatically sync this. I use &amp;ldquo;DropSync&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Tasker&amp;rdquo; for this. DropSync allows to sync any dropbox folder to the phone and tasker automates this process while taking care of not disturbing your normal phone use. I set it up like this:
a. Setup DropSync to do only manual sync.
b. In Tasker, create a profile with this conditions:
i) An hourly repeating time event from 10 PM to 6 AM
ii) Wifi is connected instead of mobile data
iii) Location context is home (from another of my profiles. You can instead choose to use your specific home wifi ssid in above step)
iv) Phone is getting charged (so that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t lose power in the middle)
c. Profile enter task is setup to check a variable if sync is done or not. If not done, then trigger the sync and then set the sync done variable.
d. Profile exit task is setup to clear the sync done variable for next day.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Rahul (my friend and guest author on this blog) introduced me to an old-but-useful trick a few days ago that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about. It&amp;rsquo;s about customizing nautilus to display a context menu that has a few of your chosen scripts to weave their magic on the selected object. And the procedure to do this is summarized in just two steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Write your script.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Save it in ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts and make it executable&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Of course, if you don&amp;rsquo;t know scripting the first step itself is quite daunting, but you can get a lot of pre-cooked scripts on the internet by searching for &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=nautilus+scripts&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search">nautilus scripts&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;. e.g. take a look at &lt;a href="http://g-scripts.sourceforge.net/">g-scripts homepage&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To get you started immediately, here is a crude example to open a terminal/console window in any folder/path through right-click menu:&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Step 1) Write your script (any scripting language: shell, perl, python, etc):&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Step 2) Save it in ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts, name it as &amp;ldquo;Terminal&amp;rdquo; and make it executable.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Step 3) Now, you should see a &amp;ldquo;Scripts&amp;rdquo; option in your right-click menu as shown below. Clicking on &amp;ldquo;Terminal&amp;rdquo; will open a new terminal window with the present working directory being set to the selected folder.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="/img/uploads/nautilus_scripts.png">&lt;img src="/img/uploads/nautilus_scripts_thumb.jpg" alt="Nautilus_scripts">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note:&lt;/strong> If you don&amp;rsquo;t see the &amp;ldquo;scripts&amp;rdquo; menu option (or your script name in the extended menu), then just run&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Let me know if you face any problems with this or have any other questions.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote></content></item><item><title>Ubuntu TIP: Automating Package Installation – apt-get to the rescue</title><link>/2008/03/06/ubuntu-tip-automating-package-installation--apt-get-to-the-rescue/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2008 03:30:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2008/03/06/ubuntu-tip-automating-package-installation--apt-get-to-the-rescue/</guid><description>Admin Note: Rahul is a long time friend of mine, and is a well known geek amongst his friends and colleagues.

I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that he will be enriching this site from time-to-time as a guest editor/author. First up is a small tid-bit of a script that he wrote to ease up his life between installations and reinstallations of everyone&amp;rsquo;s favourite OS: Ubuntu. Over to his post..&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Have you ever had to reinstall your ubuntu installation, and then bear the pain of manually installing the applications you&amp;rsquo;ve come to love (i mean use :)) everyday? If yes, then cheer up buddy, because all you really need is some magic (read scripting), some typing and spend some time digging the package names of your favourite applications.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To get started, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to type the package information in a configuration file. The format of the file is really simple&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Any line starting with a # is ignored&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Blank lines are ignored&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Any other line, the first word is taken as the package name you want to install&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In case you do not specify the configFile (e.g. package-names.lst), it will bug you to manually enter packages names :D.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What this script does is&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>read package names from the file specified (or bug user for package names in case filename is not specified)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>install these packages&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s it. And if everything runs fine, you should have a system will all your beloved apps installed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The below snippet from the sample configuration file would install the packages – hardinfo, gmountiso, devilspie and nautilus-open-terminal. The lines for sysinfo and istanbul would be ignored. In case you later wish to install these packages, all you need to do is uncomment the line, and run the script again :).&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Note:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The script will fail in case the package cannot be found using the repositories enabled on your system.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>In case you use additional repositories, you must add these manually to your apt configuration file, and do&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>The hard part is not the installation, but setting up the applications to your likings :D&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
