&lt;p>Seeing no-one picking it up, I decided to give it a bit of polish last weekend by fixing the above problems and also add a few features.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope to continue on the good work that was done by the original author and provide an even better xwinwrap to you all. Pour in those ideas about what features you&amp;rsquo;d like to see in this.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Shantz XWinWrap</title><link>/2008/09/03/shantz-xwinwrap/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2008 14:41:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2008/09/03/shantz-xwinwrap/</guid><description>XWinWrap is a small utility written a loooong time ago that allowed you to stick most of the apps to your desktop background.

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Well, sticking didn&amp;rsquo;t work. So if you did a &amp;ldquo;minimize all&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;go to desktop&amp;rdquo; kind of thing, your &amp;ldquo;wallpaper&amp;rdquo; got minimized as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The geometry option didn&amp;rsquo;t work, so you could not create, e.g., a small matrix window surrounded by your original wallpaper.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Seeing no-one picking it up, I decided to give it a bit of polish last weekend by fixing the above problems and also add a few features. And here it is, in its new avatar &amp;ldquo;Shantz XWinWrap&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Video:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Usage&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The download file above contains 32 bit as well as 64 bit binaries. (Deb packages for ubuntu/debian are also included in the same file)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Though a lot of options are shown below, the only ones you&amp;rsquo;d most likely need are &amp;ldquo;fs&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;g&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;ov&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sh&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>

&lt;p>15-Feb-2009:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>

&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Provided an option to specify the desktop window name.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Added Debug messages.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Fixed a bug where the generated window overlapped other windows.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>28-Aug-2008:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Fixed &amp;ldquo;sticky&amp;rdquo;, now it sticks like a true wallpaper to your desktop.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Fixed &amp;ldquo;geometry&amp;rdquo; option. Now you can create smaller windows and draw/position them anywhere on your screen.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
