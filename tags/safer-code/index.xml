I apologize for the same. I’ve been swamped by loads of work for quite some time now and haven’t been able to write anything here or update any of my projects, though I have loads of new hacks and tricks that I would write once I’m free and lots in store for most of the projects as well in form of bug fixes and new features.</description><content>&lt;p>Many readers of this blog have written to me for the slow updates. I apologize for the same. I’ve been swamped by loads of work for quite some time now and haven’t been able to write anything here or update any of my projects, though I have loads of new hacks and tricks that I would write once I’m free and lots in store for most of the projects as well in form of bug fixes and new features. So, hang in there :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meanwhile, take a look at this post ( &lt;a href="http://www.safercode.com/blog/2008/10/14/int-main-vs-void-main.html">int Main() vs void main()&lt;/a> )that I had made some time ago at another blog of mine ( &lt;a href="http://www.safercode.com/blog/">Safer Code - Secure Coding In C \ C++ And More&lt;/a> ). Why I’m telling you about this post is that it is a really important post useful for every C / C++ developer and recently it got featured on LinuxToday and Lxer, after which there is a very interesting discussion going on to discuss the various aspects related to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do check out the rest of the blog as well. It is about tit-bits of security, optimization and performance of your code and in a manner and amount that you can easily digest. What’s best is that it is delivered regularly at a slow pace that everyone can follow :). So, what are you waiting for? Add it to your feed reader or choose to get the updates through e-mail and do let me know in the comments there how you like it.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
