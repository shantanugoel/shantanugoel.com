But I&amp;rsquo;ll try my best to update as often as possible. There are a couple of useful apps that I wrote some time ago but havent found time to add all the features that I wanted and to roll them out, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll release them with the current feature set.</description></item><item><title>Site Updates</title><link>/posts/site-updates/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Feb 2008 05:05:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/site-updates/</guid><description>The site received a lot of new visitors yesterday as one of the small-time things that I do, received front page treatment at lifehacker.
