But I&amp;rsquo;ll try my best to update as often as possible. There are a couple of useful apps that I wrote some time ago but havent found time to add all the features that I wanted and to roll them out, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll release them with the current feature set.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meanwhile, today I got some time free to finally update both my blogs to WordPress 2.6 and also update all the plugins to their latest versions. Don&amp;rsquo;t notice too much on the frontend, but the admin area seems much snappier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And as always, please let me know if there is anything specific that you want me to write about in near future.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Site Updates</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/22/site-updates/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Feb 2008 05:05:04 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/22/site-updates/</guid><description>The site received a lot of new visitors yesterday as one of the small-time things that I do, received front page treatment at lifehacker.
