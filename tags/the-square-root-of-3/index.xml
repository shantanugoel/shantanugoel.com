Cool movie, though not as awesome as &amp;ldquo;Go to White Castle&amp;rdquo; one. But one thing that I liked was the poem that Kumar (Kal Penn) recites in an attempt to woo back her love by embarrassing himself more than he had embarrassed her (Yes, you can see such situations only in H&amp;amp;K movies ;) ). The poem is actually written by one &amp;ldquo;David Feinberg&amp;rdquo;.</description></item></channel></rss>
