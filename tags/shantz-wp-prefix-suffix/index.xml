I got this idea because people told me that this was one of the most sought after option as advertisements (e.g. google adsense, adbrite, etc) give maximum click through rate when placed smack dab in the middle of the content. What’s more is that it is configurable and you can choose how many paragraphs and/or words should be skipped from the start of the post before you add whatever you want, be it text, css, html, php or javascript.</description><content>&lt;p>Well, its not just prefix suffix any more, because I added an option to add things in the middle of the posts as well.

Examples of use cases could be to include your copyright message, advertisements (like adsense, etc), permalinks, your other site links, any other custom messages.

&lt;p>Changes in this version include options to enable/disable displaying the text/code on home page and excerpts. Also a small bug was fixed that displayed the code even if it was chosen not to.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Project: My WordPress Plugin "Shantz WP Prefix Suffix" Updated to 1.0.4</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/10/15/project-my-wordpress-plugin-shantz-wp-prefix-suffix-updated-to-104/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2008 12:48:42 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/10/15/project-my-wordpress-plugin-shantz-wp-prefix-suffix-updated-to-104/</guid><description>For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know Shantz-WP-Prefix-Suffix is a WordPress plugin that allows you to add any text and/or HTML/CSS/PHP/Javascript code to the top or bottom of your posts (e.g. see my site links at top of each post and the copyright link and permalink at the bottom of each) I&amp;rsquo;ve updated it to version 1.0.4 which allows you to add PHP code to the top or bottom of your posts now.</description><content>&lt;p>For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know Shantz-WP-Prefix-Suffix is a WordPress plugin that allows you to add any text and/or HTML/CSS/PHP/Javascript code to the top or bottom of your posts (e.g. see my site links at top of each post and the copyright link and permalink at the bottom of each)
