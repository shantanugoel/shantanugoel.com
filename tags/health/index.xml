So, naturally I use headphones a lot, especially due to the video calls situation forced by the pandemic. Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve been having this uneasy feeling for a long time which is sort of like a headache but not really and it&amp;rsquo;s been gnawing at me. I attributed this to lack of sleep, stress, etc early on but then recently realized the main culprit for this is headphones that&amp;rsquo;s constantly keeping my ears busy.</description></item></channel></rss>
