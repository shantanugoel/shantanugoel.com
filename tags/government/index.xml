&lt;p>It looks as if the Indian government is not content with its inability to decrypt their citizens BlackBerry e-mails, and is threatening a shutdown of Research In Motion&amp;rsquo;s devices in the country as punishment. &lt;em>Business Standard&lt;/em> reports that the Indian government desires access to RIM&amp;rsquo;s proprietary e-mail network, in order to monitor e-mails being sent and received through the country. It is reported that a meeting will take place on March 14th, involving RIM representatives, members of wireless companies within the country, and representatives of the Indian government.&lt;/p>
