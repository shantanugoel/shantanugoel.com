But I&amp;rsquo;ll try my best to update as often as possible. There are a couple of useful apps that I wrote some time ago but havent found time to add all the features that I wanted and to roll them out, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll release them with the current feature set.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meanwhile, today I got some time free to finally update both my blogs to WordPress 2.6 and also update all the plugins to their latest versions. Don&amp;rsquo;t notice too much on the frontend, but the admin area seems much snappier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And as always, please let me know if there is anything specific that you want me to write about in near future.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
