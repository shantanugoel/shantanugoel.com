But when I started it, it was crashing with some weird error about not being able to open mixer devices.

Just run it in the following way:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>pasuspender -- ./FretsOnFire&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And it will start working just fine. You can use the same trick for any other application that needs direct access to the sound devices. What pasuspender does is that it will suspend pulse audio and allow the application to access them directly and when the application is terminated, normal functioning will resume.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
