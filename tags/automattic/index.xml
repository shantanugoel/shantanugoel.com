Yes, WordPress 2.5 final has been released and even WordPress.org has undergone a total revamp to match the release.
Yes, I just downloaded it through WordPress.org though canâ€™t find it being mentioned anywhere on WordPress Development Blog. Did they forget to announce it or somebody over at Automattic put up the link by mistake. Anyways, if you want to get it at the earliest as well, head over to the WordPress Release Archive and look at the very bottom of the page.</description></item></channel></rss>
