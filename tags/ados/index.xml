The router has open source firmware so people can develop applications for it.

&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s see what it says:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[Error] Description: An error occured while connecting to the remote server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Probable Reasons: Probable reasons can be found in the error&amp;rsquo;s description. (Hmmm, lets wait &amp;amp; watch)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Probable Solutions: Probable soulutions (sic) can be found in the error&amp;rsquo;s description. (Yay!! Alrightâ€¦.hey, wait a sec, how am I supposed to find a solution from a description that says &amp;ldquo;An error occured&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, that&amp;rsquo;s it for now folks. Am off to the himalayas to get some training from the mahatmas in the exquisite art of psychic healing (and router apps bug fixing).&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
