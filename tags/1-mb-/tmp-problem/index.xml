Many of the applications, that he regularly used, were misbehaving. e.g., he couldn&amp;rsquo;t play flash videos in firefox, downloads were failing, installation of new applications were failing, etc. Everything was giving errors of not enough disk space even though he had quite a few GBs left on his drive. A few of the error messages pointed out that there wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough space in /tmp.</description></item></channel></rss>
