&lt;p>I guess this is a reason for us to rejoice because of two reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>This would definitely make life that much more better as the open source developers fix these particular drivers (ALSA people, start your engines)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>This also means another big inroads into the commercial world for open source as creative is definitely one of the big boys around.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Now, I wish NVidia would see the light of the day as well. Creative guys, care to take a trip down to Santa Clara to share your reasonings with our GPU brothers :)&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
