Now, it seems that the Finnish Giant Nokia has a lot of X-Men lovers as well, as they put out their latest offering to us lesser mortals.

&lt;p>The Morph concept device is a bridge between highly advanced technologies and their potential benefits to end-users. This device concept showcases some revolutionary leaps being explored by Nokia Research Center (NRC) in collaboration with the Cambridge Nanoscience Centre (United Kingdom) – nanoscale technologies that will potentially create a world of radically different devices that open up an entirely new spectrum of possibilities.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>Who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t agree that Morph is most probably the coolest mutant (besides Wolverine of course :) ).

&lt;p>Yeah, yeah, museum-shmuseum, nanotech-shanotech. All I know is that until I see this thing up on &lt;code>put your favourite retailer name here&lt;/code>, my call is &amp;ldquo;vaporware&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
