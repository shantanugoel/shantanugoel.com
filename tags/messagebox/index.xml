Earlier I had done this using my Odroid U2 and Tasker/AutoRemote but this was limiting as this meant that I could see the notifications only when I was watching something through the Odroid. Samsung TVs, which are DLNA enabled, also include a hidden service called &amp;ldquo;Message Box&amp;rdquo; which can display different information on the TV natively irrespective of which display mode/input mode you are in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had come across this while reverse engineering the DLNA protocol extensions that Samsung had built in their TVs to get subtitles working over DLNA but didn&amp;rsquo;t put much thought into it. Fueled by the new Raspberry Pi I recently acquired (more on this later below), I set out to find out the details of this service and exploit it for my need and a few hours later, samsung-messagebox was born :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can get it from here:Â &lt;a href="https://github.com/shantanugoel/samsung-messagebox">https://github.com/shantanugoel/samsung-messagebox&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Usage:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code> usage: samsung-msgbox.py -i IP -m MSG [-p PORT] [-t TIME] [-r RECEIVER]
[-x RECEIVER_NO] [-s SENDER] [-y SENDER_NO] [-h]
Send an arbitrary text message to Samsung TVs which is displayed onscreen.
Developed by Shantanu Goel (http://tech.shantanugoel.com/) version 1.0
Arguments:
-i IP, --ip IP Required. IP Address of the TV
-m MSG, --msg MSG Required. Message body text to be sent to TV
-p PORT, --port PORT Optional. Port on which message should be sent
-t TIME, --time TIME Optional. Receive date and time in epoch/unix format
-r RECEIVER, --receiver RECEIVER
Optional. Receiver Name
-x RECEIVER_NO, --receiverno RECEIVER_NO
Optional. Receiver Number
-s SENDER, --sender SENDER
Optional. Sender Name
-y SENDER_NO, --senderno SENDER_NO
Optional. Sender Number
-h, --help
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve tested it currently with my 2010 C Series TV. Hopefully, it should work with any TV that has this service. If you face any problems then let me know and I can try to add support for your TV.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Raspberry PI:&lt;/strong> So, where does raspberry pi figure in all this? Well, I wanted to display my incoming call/text alerts on my TV. So, I made a small webserver in python that I run on my raspberry pi, listening for some special parameters. Whenever I get a call or SMS, I created a tasker profile to call this server with the call/sms parameters and the server in turn calls the above samsung-messagebox.py script to display the alerts. I&amp;rsquo;m also planning to integrate it with a dropbox based service to put it to more uses. Let me know if you have any ideas in mind.&lt;/p>
