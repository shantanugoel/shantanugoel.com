Anyways, I drift. In the mood to try out the NFC capbilities of my newly acquired gadget I thought of doing something about my car audio setup (previously consisting of a stereo line connecting the aux port of the stereo to the headphone out of Nexus one using tasker to start music when connected).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before I go into how I went about it, here is what it does now. When I keep the phone into my car&amp;rsquo;s phone holder, it automatically starts streaming music over BT from my car stereo and then when I keep it in my pocket, it stops.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ingredients I used:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>1 Galaxy Nexus&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>2 NFC tags (bought from tagstand guys. Makers of the awesome NFC Tasker Launcher app)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>1 male to male stereo cable&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>1 Samsung HS3000 BT headset (since my car stereo doesn&amp;rsquo;t have BT. This little headset is awesome because it is cheap (25$ or so at amazon), has a stereo port where you can connect any headset or stereo cable, implements apt-x protocol for high fidelity audio streaming)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Android App: NFC Task Launcher&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Android App: Tasker (NFC task launcher is enough for basic things but my task is a bit more involved)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Android App: Secure Settings plugin for Tasker/Locale&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So, what I did is this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Hardware&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pasted one NFC tag to my car phone holder and kept another one in my wallet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Connected the HS3000 headset to the car stereo through aux-in and to power through a car charger (it uses a standard micro usb port to charge).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stuck the HS3000 near my dashboard. I could have hidden it in dashboard or somewhere but I also wanted to use it to take calls when they come in so I can use its mic for speaking and incoming audio sounds through the car speakers. You can also disconnect the internal battery by popping up the casing so that it turns on and off with the car but it isn&amp;rsquo;t necessary as it anyways turns off if there is no device connected for a while.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Software&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Created two tasks in Tasker. First as &amp;ldquo;Car Mode Enter&amp;rdquo; and second as &amp;ldquo;Car Mode Exit&amp;rdquo;. The car mode enter task basically does this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If car mode is not already running (based on a variable)&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Turn on Bluetooth (This also auto connects)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Crank up the Media Volume&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If Battery level is above 40%&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Keep the screen always on (using Secure Settings)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Else keep the screen on if power is connected (through car charger)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Crank up the brightness if it is day time (so that I can see the screen) and store the old value for restoring later.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If navigation is not on (through another variable set through another profile which monitors if a navigation or maps app is in foreground)&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Load the Music app&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Start playing music&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Turn on the Read SMS profile cuz I&amp;rsquo;m a safe driver :) (Another profile in tasker which reads the incoming SMS&amp;rsquo; sender&amp;rsquo;s name and asks if it should read the text (don&amp;rsquo;t want anyÂ embarrassing ones read out while others are there in my car ;)) and then proceeds to read the text if I speak &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo;. For anything else or no input, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t read the text)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The car mode exit task undoes everything done in the car mode enter task and restores everything to how it was before entering the car mode.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also created two tasks in NFC task launcher which just launch the car mode enter and exit tasks when tapped against 1 of the tags and wrote this task to the tags.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>All together now:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we are done now. Now when I enter my car, I place the phone on the holder and nice music starts playing. When I get out, I tap it against my pocket (with the wallet) and everything is back at normal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let me know if you need any more information about the above setup or the tasker profile xml files. I use tasker for automating a whole other bunch of things as well. Will try to post that stuff soon along with any other NFC tricks I try out.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Camera LED As Flashlight on Non-Rooted Android Phones</title><link>/2010/07/30/camera-led-flashlight-non-rooted-android-phones/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2010 09:31:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2010/07/30/camera-led-flashlight-non-rooted-android-phones/</guid><description>We all know that Android does not allow the camera LED to be controlled directly from apps and hence, you cannot use the camera LED as a Torch or Flashlight unless you are rooted.

There are many flashlight apps on the Android Market Place but none of them will work for you if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a rooted phone. BUT this changed recently. I use a brilliant app called &amp;ldquo;quick settings&amp;rdquo; which keeps an icon in the notification bar and I can pull it down and change any settings without leaving other apps. It has a flashlight function but so far it used to work by turning on the screen with a white screen, which was a less than ideal solution. I upgraded to the latest version a few days ago (1.9.4 p1). While messing around with the settings, I wandered across the flashlight settings which allows you to choose what kind of flashlight you want. Now, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure whether this setting was present earlier or not but I decided to give it a try and chose LED instead of screen (Screenshot below):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="/img/uploads/quick-settings-flash-android-settings.png">&lt;img src="/img/uploads/quick-settings-flash-android-settings-thumb.png" alt="Android Quick Settings Flashlight LED Settings">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once done, I went back to the main screen and pressed the flashlight icon in the top right (Screen shot below) and voila! my camera LED switched on. I&amp;rsquo;m a happy camper now as this is a life saver many times. Try this out for yourself by searching for &amp;ldquo;Quick Settings&amp;rdquo; in the market and let me know if it works on your phone too (mine is a nexus one).&lt;/p>

It is mainly concentrated towards listing the features/fixes that we have seen in Froyo that weren&amp;rsquo;t announced in Google I/O, things that work with nexus one, things that don&amp;rsquo;t and possible fixes/workarounds known, what the announced features actually feel like in real use etc.** Will keep updating this post as I get more info, get more fixes, etc. Please do let me know if I&amp;rsquo;ve missed something or there is some new development that should be updated here.**&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**UPDATED: **&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>27-MAY-2010 (Added things missing since Eclair and few other notes)&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>25-MAY-2010 (Added market missing apps fix, 802.11n and other features)&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>24-MAY-2010 (Added more un-announced features/fixes/changes)&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>To start with, just a quick recap of things that were announced and their look/feel/working in real use (First is the announced feature and then after &amp;ldquo;:&amp;rdquo; is the effect that we see)&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Feature/Fix&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Real Effects seen by us&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Remarks&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>JIT for Dalvik JVM&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Apps are quite fast, visible difference animation effects, scrolling, games etc&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>None&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Better Exchange support with calendar sync/GAL /remote wipe/account-auto-discovery/administation&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Works as advertised&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Exchange support still not upto the mark. e.g. No support for selective folder sync, subfolders are not synced automatically, no phone number/location for GAL contacts, no âmove to folderâ, no search, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Backup Application data/settings/history in cloud&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Yet to experience&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve enabled the settings for this but haven&amp;rsquo;t switched to another ROM yet or figured out how to test it in some other way.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Cloud Messaging to activate intents&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Works as advertised&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>very cool feature. Try out this chrome extension to send links from chrome to your phone: &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/chrometophone/">Chrome2Phone&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>USB Tethering and Portable Wireless Hotspot&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Works as advertised&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Real skin-saver. Works great and easily.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Javascript V8 Engine for Android Browser&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Much faster javascript execution&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Much better browsing experience noted.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>HTML5 support/Device Access (Camera/Accelerometer etc) through Browser&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Work In Progress. See Remarks&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Contrary to what many people tell you, this is still not there. HTML5 support is an ongoing thing and device access through browser would be present in Gingerbread (Next Android iteration, supposedly 3.0)&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Better Voice Input Integration&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Seems&amp;rdquo; better.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Now, I don&amp;rsquo;t have any tangible means to measure this but it seems to be working relatively better and it even seems to understand my non-US accent much better.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Flash 10.1 beta support&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Works as advertised&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Almost every flash functionality in all sites I visited work ok. Please note that you need to install Flash from market as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t come &amp;ldquo;built-in&amp;rdquo;. Just search for &amp;ldquo;Adobe&amp;rdquo; in market.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Install apps on SD card&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Not tested.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>This feature requires support from apps to integrate this and currently no apps support it. There is a command that you can run from adb shell &amp;ldquo;adb shell pm setInstallLocation 2&amp;rdquo; but it will cause &amp;ldquo;all&amp;rdquo; your apps to install to the card plus users report problems on missing apps as SD card is not available immediately at boot up.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Better global search integration for apps&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Works as advertised&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Now, apps can allow search to search within their data. Right now the official twitter app supports this and you can search your timeline from the main android search itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Update all apps in one click/automatic updates&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Works as advertised&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>None.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Stream music from PC to phone&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Yet to test.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>None. As pointed out by Hugo, it is not clear yet that this is supposed to be part of Froyo or GingerBread.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Improved crash reporting to developers&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Works as advertised&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Really useful to the developers as it sends complete report about the environment and stack trace etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Purchase music/apps on android market and push directly to device Over The Air&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Yet to test&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>New market website that allows this hasn&amp;rsquo;t appeared yet. As pointed out by Hugo, it is not clear yet that this is supposed to be part of Froyo or GingerBread.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Now, we move on to things that weren&amp;rsquo;t announced but we found them in the updates. This may be because these pieces were too small or specific to nexus one to have warranted a place in the Google I/O keynote.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Feature/Fix&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Remarks&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Erratic/Crazy Touchscreen behaviour fixes&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>This is about the erratic behaviour of the touchscreen that sometimes all the touches were being registered at the wrong places and one had to tap twice on the power button to fix it. So far, it seems that this has been fixed.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Multi-touch fixes&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>This seems to be a hardware problem and there are no &amp;ldquo;fixes&amp;rdquo; to it as such but there seems to be a new touchscreen API in the 2.2 Froyo SDK that google is encouraging developers to use to alleviate this issue somewhat by doing some filtering/scaling within the Android framework.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>SMS App fix&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>The messaging app had a nagging issue that many times it showed the first few words of a text message as the sender instead of the actual number/sender. This seems to be fixed now.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Capacitive Touch Button fix&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Nexus one was quite famous for its mal-functioning cap-touch buttons that didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to register the touches of a user. We had to press slightly above them most times to register a touch. This seems to be fixed now and feels much better.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Multi-Color Trackball&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>The nexus one trackball can now display multiple colors instead of just white. e.g. a nee facebook update received makes it glow blue :)&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Better Camera/Gallery Interface&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>The new camera/gallery interface is just awesome and much easier to use. Feature wise I think the new options are focus settings, zoom settings and storage location quick switch, flash on during video recording for night video capture. I must also mention that auto-flash works much better now as earlier it used to almost always fire even in quite ample light but that maybe just me.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Now, on our list are things/apps that don&amp;rsquo;t work or issues that plague the new update. We will also be listing the workarounds/fixes if known for them.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Issues&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Fix/Workaround/Remarks&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Seesmic app keeps giving &amp;ldquo;Connection error&amp;rdquo; with froyo&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Simple fix is to delete your existing account in seesmic. Setup a new account and uncheck &amp;ldquo;Secure connection&amp;rdquo; in advanced setup.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Swype doesn&amp;rsquo;t work&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Just uninstall swype and swype installer and download/install them again and it will work.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Pure Calendar doesn&amp;rsquo;t work&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>New versions have been released to make them work&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Android market doesn&amp;rsquo;t show a lot of apps&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>As of now, android market is not showing a lot of paid/copy-protected apps on the market for froyo users. There is a workaround for root users available here: &lt;a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=687371">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=687371&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Worse radio/3G performance&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Several users at modaco/xda-devs report worse performance with 3G. They say downgrading back to previous radio fixes this but try it at your own risk.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Things missing since previous versions (i.e. Eclair):&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(Thanks to Marc for suggestion)&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Things missing&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>No â.comâ button on the default Android keyboard&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The final part of this post is for things that were rumored to be in the Froyo update for nexus one but aren&amp;rsquo;t present:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>**Rumored Feature/fix **(Not present in Nexus One Froyo Update)&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>FM Radio Receiver&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>FM Transmitter&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s it for now. This is a huge post and I must have missed out on a lot of things for sure. So, if you remember something that I have missed or something has changed over past few days after I wrote/updated this post, please do let me know in comments.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Android Froyo Update File</title><link>/2010/05/22/android-froyo-update/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 May 2010 19:36:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2010/05/22/android-froyo-update/</guid><description>Just a quick post to tell you how to update your Nexus One to Android 2.2 Froyo immediately without waiting for google to send it to you OTA.
