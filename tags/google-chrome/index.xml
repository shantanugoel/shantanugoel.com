And sharkzapper is a cool chrome extension that puts the control and information about anything playing in your grooveshark chrome tab into a little button on the address bar. It is a very good extension but I felt that what it was missing was lyrics. Before I could comment on the extension&amp;rsquo;s chrome market page, I noticed that it has a github repository.</description></item><item><title>Chrome Script/Extension installation error: Could not read source file</title><link>/posts/chrome-scriptextension-installation-error-could-not-read-source-file/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2011 16:58:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/chrome-scriptextension-installation-error-could-not-read-source-file/</guid><description>This is a solution to the issue that I faced today while installing a javascript file from userscripts.org as an extension into google chrome (Yes, Chrome supports installing greasemonkey javascripts as extensions). I had already installed this script once into my browser earlier but when I tried installing it again today, it started giving me a weird error &amp;ldquo;Could not read source file&amp;rdquo;. I tried all possible means, like putting it on a different server, installing from local disk, changing versions, deleting all cache, etc but still the issue persisted.</description></item></channel></rss>
