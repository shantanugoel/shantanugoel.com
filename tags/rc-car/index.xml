Pretty nice real time movement control and camera pan/tilt control through websockets with a live stream feeding back to any browser directly from the car through mjpg-streamer

Casted my Nexus 5 screen to the TV simultaneously while controlling the car :) )</description></item><item><title>Converting A Toy RC Car Into An Autonomous Fun Car The Indian Way</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2014/07/23/converting-a-toy-rc-car-into-an-autonomous-fun-car-the-indian-way/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2014 17:05:12 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2014/07/23/converting-a-toy-rc-car-into-an-autonomous-fun-car-the-indian-way/</guid><description>Dangerous is a mind which is left grounded at home for days.
