Most of the times, this is as simple as adding some simple lines to .htaccess (e.g. AddHandler application/x-httpd-php5 .php ). And you might not notice any issues. But many of you still do. The issues range from weird page layouts, to some controls not working, to some errors popping up here and there, and probably your blog not even displaying.</description></item><item><title>Project: shantz-wp-qotd and shantz-wp-prefix-suffix updated</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/15/project-shantz-wp-qotd-and-shantz-wp-prefix-suffix-updated/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2008 17:26:52 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/15/project-shantz-wp-qotd-and-shantz-wp-prefix-suffix-updated/</guid><description>Just some news on my WordPress plugins front. shantz-wp-qotd has been updated to version 1.2.1 and shantz-wp-prefix-suffix has been updated to 1.0.1. It is just a minor update meant for people still using a WordPress version &amp;lt; 2.1. The update makes the &amp;ldquo;page exclusion&amp;rdquo; feature of both the plugins (i.e. the option to prevent the plugins from acting on &amp;ldquo;pages&amp;rdquo;) compatible with WP &amp;lt; 2.1 as well.
