It is just a minor update meant for people still using a WordPress version &amp;lt; 2.1. The update makes the &amp;ldquo;page exclusion&amp;rdquo; feature of both the plugins (i.e. the option to prevent the plugins from acting on &amp;ldquo;pages&amp;rdquo;) compatible with WP &amp;lt; 2.1 as well.
