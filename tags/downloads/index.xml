This app basically allows you to change the wi-fi sleep policy on android so that you can keep your wi-fi connected even if the phone goes to sleep (i.e. screen turns off). What&amp;rsquo;s more is that I&amp;rsquo;ve added a widget to it so you don&amp;rsquo;t even have to go into the app. Just tap on the widget to cycle through the settings.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Apology For Bad Downloads</title><link>/2008/09/05/apology-for-bad-downloads/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2008 16:13:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2008/09/05/apology-for-bad-downloads/</guid><description>Guys, for the past few days if you downloaded any &amp;ldquo;.tar.gz&amp;rdquo; packages from this site (like my splert or shantz-xwinwrap tools), then you&amp;rsquo;d have got a corrupt package.

&lt;p>Today, this blog completes one month of its existence in this world. The achievements, although minuscule in comparison to all the biggies out there, are significant for me. It achieved the following things in just 30 days from the first post:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Front-paged at &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/358749/retrieve-any-file-on-your-home-computer-via-email-windows-edition">LifeHacker&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://hackszine.com/blog/archive/2008/02/remote_file_access_through_ema.html">HacksZine&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="http://www.google.co.in/search?q=shantanu+goel+remote+file+access+through+e-mail+outlook&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;aq=t&amp;amp;rls=com.ubuntu:en-US:official&amp;amp;client=firefox-a">many others&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Over 10000 (Ten Thousand) &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>unique&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong>&lt;em>human&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> visitors.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Over 30000 (Thirty Thousand) page views by &lt;strong>&lt;em>humans&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Over 500000 (Half Million) total hits for all website files included.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Around 800 downloads of my projects&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Makes it to the first page on google for many keywords (like wm6.1 htc wizard, ubuntu two soundcards, and many others)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>A &lt;a href="http://www.google.co.in/search?q=shantanu+goel">google&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=shantanu+goel">yahoo&lt;/a> search for my name “shantanu goel” now gives around 6–7 links about me (4–5 from this blog) out of the first 10 results. (This changes quite dynamically though)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>But this is all because of you, the readers. Thanks a lot and keep coming. I hope I can continue writing stuff you like, because ultimately a blog is written for the people and not for search engines.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Site Updates: More Content For You</title><link>/2008/02/03/site-updates-more-content-for-you/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Feb 2008 19:36:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2008/02/03/site-updates-more-content-for-you/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve added a few new sections to the blog.
