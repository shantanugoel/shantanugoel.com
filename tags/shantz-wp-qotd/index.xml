&lt;p>I recommend that you update to this new version asap, as apart from the above mentioned changes, the code is a bit more cleaner as well, which would run a bit better IMO and also help in any modification if you have in mind.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>My First WordPress Plugin: Please Welcome shantz-wp-qotd</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/10/my-first-wordpress-plugin-please-welcome-shantz-wp-qotd/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Feb 2008 11:00:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/10/my-first-wordpress-plugin-please-welcome-shantz-wp-qotd/</guid><description>&lt;p>Motivated by Ronald’s ultimate wordpress plugin tutorial at &lt;a href="http://www.devlounge.net/extras/how-to-write-a-wordpress-plugin">devlounge&lt;/a>, I decided that the best way to learn something is to use it in a live project. Armed with my laptop and multiple flasks of coffee, the marathon began on Friday night. My only experience with web-related development so far had been around 8–10 years ago as a kid when, just like everybody else at that time, I was fascinated by HTML and did a “read-through” of HTML 4.0. But I have always been a believer of the theory that a C programmer can program in any language quickly without having to go through the whole manuals. Thus that night bore fruit for me, and by 5:30 in the morning I had a working “Quote of The Day” plugin at my hand with all the features I wanted it to have in its first avatar. Did a bit of polishing last night, fixed a few bugs, and created a readme, and here it is, Mr. shantz-wp-qotd “1.0”, in all its glory, ready for general consumption.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>Motivated by Ronald’s ultimate wordpress plugin tutorial at &lt;a href="http://www.devlounge.net/extras/how-to-write-a-wordpress-plugin">devlounge&lt;/a>, I decided that the best way to learn something is to use it in a live project.
