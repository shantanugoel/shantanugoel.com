For those who are still living under a rock (just kidding :P), this is a plugin that allows you to add any kind of text/html/css/php/javascript code to any of your posts or pages with lots of controls over what to display, where to display, etc etc. So, you could use it as an ad-manager or a copyright notice adder (to thwart those feed scrapers) or just add some friendly messages or related posts, etc for your readers.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>Here comes another update, and this time it is a majorly recommended one.

&lt;p>This particular version fixes a bug that popped up in the last version that the settings were no longer being saved. Also fixed some minor cosmetic issues.

And you get a lot of options to control all this. I use it even on my site, to create links for my other blogs, adding copyright notices and even for advertisements (google adsense, chitika premium, etc).&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>My WordPress Plugin &amp;ldquo;Shantz Wordpress Prefix Suffix&amp;rdquo; has just been updated to version 1.1.2.

&lt;p>This update brings in WordPress 2.7.1 compatibility and also another option to control the plugin order. If there are some other plugins that add content to your posts (e.g. sociable, simple tags, related posts, etc), you might notice that the text/code you append with this plugin may not occur in exactly the place you want (e.g. you might want to occur after all other plugins have posted their content). So, you can easily control this now by changing the priority value in the plugin settings. Make it higher to push the content down and lower it to add your content before anything else.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Project: Shantz-WP-Prefix-Suffix Updated to 1.1.0</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/11/20/project-shantz-wp-prefix-suffix-updated-to-110/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2008 04:08:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/11/20/project-shantz-wp-prefix-suffix-updated-to-110/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well, its not just prefix suffix any more, because I added an option to add things in the middle of the posts as well.

What’s more is that it is configurable and you can choose how many paragraphs and/or words should be skipped from the start of the post before you add whatever you want, be it text, css, html, php or javascript.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>Well, its not just prefix suffix any more, because I added an option to add things in the middle of the posts as well.

Examples of use cases could be to include your copyright message, advertisements (like adsense, etc), permalinks, your other site links, any other custom messages.

My only experience with web-related development so far had been around 8–10 years ago as a kid when, just like everybody else at that time, I was fascinated by HTML and did a “read-through” of HTML 4.0.

Thus that night bore fruit for me, and by 5:30 in the morning I had a working “Quote of The Day” plugin at my hand with all the features I wanted it to have in its first avatar.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>== Installation ==&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Shantz-WP-QOTD plugin can be installed in following easy steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Unzip &amp;ldquo;shantz-wp-qotd&amp;rdquo; archive and put all files into your &amp;ldquo;plugins&amp;rdquo; folder (/wp-content/plugins/). It is advisable to create a sub directory into the plugins folder, like /wp-content/plugins/shantz-wp-qotd/&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Activate the plugin&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Go to Options &amp;gt; Shantz WP Quotes, adjust your settings and save them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>For adding and configuring widget to sidebar, go to Presentation &amp;gt; Widgets.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>== Frequently Asked Questions ==&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>= How to add quotes anywhere in the posts/pages? =
Use the tag &lt;code>&amp;lt;!-- shantz-wp-qotd {option} --&amp;gt;&lt;/code> anywhere in your post (without the quotes).
Note:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>{option} (including the braces) has to be replaced by the quote pattern that you want: qotd, qottd or r. qotd is quote of the day, qottd is quote of that day and r is random.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The tag has to be added using the code editor and not the visual editor, otherwise it will replace the &amp;lt;, &amp;gt; with their HTML equivalents.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>= How to use the custom separator/multi-line quotes? =
By default, if you leave the custom separator box blank, the plugin uses a newline character as the separator. However, if you have quotes that have multiple lines, you can change this to a tag of your choice, say [quote]. Now, in your quotes file (or quotes pasted in admin panel options) add this tag at the end of each quote and you are done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>= What is the format for saving quotes? =
In text box in admin page, as well as in the file, the quotes have to be saved as one on each line. Each quote is separate by newline.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>= Where is the file with quotes located =&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the get from file option, a file &amp;ldquo;quotes.txt&amp;rdquo; has to be present in the same directory where shantz-wp-qotd.php is residing. A sample quotes.txt has been given with this plugin (with some quotes from southpark, simpsons, matrix and deus ex)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>= I checked the option &amp;ldquo;exclude pages&amp;rdquo; but my pages are still displaying quotes =
Check your WordPress version. This option is effective only for Version 2.1 and above&lt;/p>
&lt;p>= How to upgrade to a new version =
Simply overwrite the old files with the new ones.&lt;/p>
