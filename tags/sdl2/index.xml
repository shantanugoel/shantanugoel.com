It's fast and correct, just as their website says. But I also liked it because it's explicit with very little magic. Though examples in the wild are a bit less since it is a fairly recent entrant compared to its competitors. For a personal side project, I needed to use SDL2 and it was the first time I had to use an external/pre-built library with bazel.</description></item></channel></rss>
