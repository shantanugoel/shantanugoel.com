Apart from the usual &amp;ldquo;smart&amp;rdquo; stuff, it does still need to display correct time :) and hence, the need for an ntp driver/client. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anyone working on that yet, so wrote up a quick and dirty implementation here:
NTP Implementation for ESP8266
It still has a lot of stuff left to be done to make it good enough for the smartwatch project but it works.</description><content>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m building a smartwatch project based around the new IoT posterkid on the block, ESP8266.

&lt;p>It still has a lot of stuff left to be done to make it good enough for the smartwatch project but it works. Feel free to try it out in your own projects and let me know how it fares :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>BTW, configure a proper ntp server address in the ntp_server variable in this file. I have a local IP there because I had to run an ntp server on one of my machines (My ISP, unfortunately, seems to be blocking all ntp traffic and I can&amp;rsquo;t query any external ntp servers).&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
