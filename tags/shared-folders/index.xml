&lt;p>If you use dropbox (A popular online storage service with free 2 GB space), and use (or intend to use) its public or shared folders feature, then you must know something about the EULA (End Users&amp;rsquo; LIcense Agreement). Yes, the one that you clicked &amp;ldquo;I Agree&amp;rdquo; on, without even reading one word of. Basically, you need to know the following lines:&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update:&lt;/strong> In a &lt;a href="http://forums.getdropbox.com/topic.php?id=4207">thread about this post at Dropbox forums&lt;/a>, it was brought to my notice that Dropbox has now changed its &lt;a href="https://www.getdropbox.com/terms#terms">terms&lt;/a> to remove the objectionable clause.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you use dropbox (A popular online storage service with free 2 GB space), and use (or intend to use) its public or shared folders feature, then you must know something about the EULA (End Users&amp;rsquo; LIcense Agreement). Yes, the one that you clicked &amp;ldquo;I Agree&amp;rdquo; on, without even reading one word of. Basically, you need to know the following lines:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>While you own the content contained in Your Files, you hereby grant all other Dropbox users a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, perpetual and irrevocable right and license to use and exploit Your Files in your public folder. In addition, you hereby grant Dropbox users who have been given access to your shared folder a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, perpetual and irrevocable right and license to use and exploit Your Files in your shared folder.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>What this means is that anything you share with anyone through dropbox falls into almost-public domain. This includes any pics, docs, source code, etc. So, be warned and use the service with care and descrition. :) PS: I searched SpiderOak&amp;rsquo;s EULA for similar terms but it looks clean to me. Are there any other services that you know having such hidden gotchas? (Although we must admit they are not so hidden after all, but it is us who turn a blind eye towards the terms)&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>TIP: Make Those Linux Samba Shares Accessible From Windows Mobile</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/30/tip-make-those-linux-samba-shares-accessible-from-windows-mobile/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2008 10:30:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/30/tip-make-those-linux-samba-shares-accessible-from-windows-mobile/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you have ever needed to share files between your Linux and Windows computers, you have obviously used &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_(software)">Samba&lt;/a>, and have been quite happy with the way it seamlessly provides access to and from shared folders/files from Windows and Linux. However, many people complain that although their smb/Samba shares are accessible from Windows, they are not able to do the same with their Windows Mobile devices. e.g., using a tool called &amp;ldquo;Resco Explorer&amp;rdquo; on Windows Mobile, all they get while searching for their linux based Samba shares is the following screenshot:&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>If you have ever needed to share files between your Linux and Windows computers, you have obviously used &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_(software)">Samba&lt;/a>, and have been quite happy with the way it seamlessly provides access to and from shared folders/files from Windows and Linux.

&lt;p>Well, there is no big magic trick to get an access to those shares, as they are already accessibly. You just need to do one more teeny little step to access them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The trick is that on Windows Mobile it will not detect your computer as having a shareable folder and will not show it, and it will thus not show a list of shared folders. So, what you need to do is enter the path to the folder you want to access. e.g.: If your computer&amp;rsquo;s name is &amp;ldquo;MyComp&amp;rdquo; and the folder you want to access is &amp;ldquo;MyFolder&amp;rdquo;, then you need to give the path &amp;ldquo;\MyComp\MyFolder&amp;rdquo; to the application on Windows Mobile from which you are trying to access your shares and it&amp;rsquo;ll connect without any problems. Of course, it&amp;rsquo;ll ask you for your username/pwd for which you need to enter your linux user name and password. Below screenshots tell you how to do this with Resco Explorer, however the same method can be used for other applications like Total Commander, Windows Mobile File Explorer, etc as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Enter Path and click share.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/2_enter_full_path.jpg" alt="Enter Full Path">&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>Enter User Name / Password&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/3_enter_user_password.jpg" alt="Enter User Name And Password">&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>Its done :-)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
