So far we’ve seen &lt;a href="/2008/06/02/tip-gadgets-deals-and-stuff-you-need-to-know-part-i.html">how to select the gadget&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="/2008/06/05/tip-gadgets-deals-and-stuff-you-need-to-know-part-ii.html">how to get the best price&lt;/a> for it. This time we’ll fill in the last remaining piece of the puzzle, the minor tit-bits that go a long way in preventing a lot of heart-burn. Don’t worry this is a short one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This last piece is to make sure that the place that you decided upon to buy your gadget, is OK in all respects, i.e., is not a fraud and has good after-sales service. You don’t have to do much, basically you just need to go thorugh a few reviews. It’s recommended you check more than a couple of these sites for your research about the seller. The main sites for this are &lt;a href="http://www.resellerratings.com/">ResellerRatings&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://bbb.org/">BBB&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://local.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Local&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://froogle.com/">Froogle&lt;/a>, and if nothing else, you can even ask questions on forums like &lt;a href="http://fatwallet.com/">FatWallet&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://slickdeals.net/">Slickdeals&lt;/a> for people’s prior experiences with your particular dealer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope the series has been informative enough for you and maybe you were able to save a few bucks. Let me know if it was so, or if you have some tricks up your sleeve that you’d like to share with others.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
