To keep your readers happy and satisfied through the week, the only options you have are burning the midnight electricity (what? You still use oil? :P) or paying up your son/nephew/wife/etc to push the publish button regularly for the drafts you wrote on weekend. Right? WRONG….
Matt and his AutoMattic team took care of bonded labour like us, and had the good heart to put in the capability of scheduling posts in WordPress (More commonly known as “future posting”).</description><content>&lt;p>If you are like me (I mean underpaid, overworked, coding zombie), then the only time you find for blogging is weekends. To keep your readers happy and satisfied through the week, the only options you have are burning the midnight electricity (what? You still use oil? :P) or paying up your son/nephew/wife/etc to push the publish button regularly for the drafts you wrote on weekend. Right? &lt;strong>WRONG&lt;/strong>….&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Matt and his AutoMattic team took care of bonded labour like us, and had the good heart to put in the capability of scheduling posts in WordPress (More commonly known as “&lt;em>future posting&lt;/em>”). So, all you have to do is say “Hey Wordy boy, here is a bagful of my posts, but don’t you dare release them before I’ve gone for my hawaii vacation. And yeah, one at a time so it can keep your tummy full till I return.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, being honest, you will have to do just a tad little bit more than that, but it’ll be a teeny weeny bit only, I promise. Read on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are using the WordPress web interface to make your posts (are you still living in the darkages? Didn’t you hear about BlogJet, Live Writer, Zoundry?), then all you have to do is that when you make your post, before pressing the publish button, look towards your lower left hand corner (No man, I mean the lower left corner of “the screen”, not your table). You will see something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="/img/uploads/wordpress_future_post_time1.png" alt="Wordpress_future_post_time1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, all you gotta do is, check that little checkbox that says “Edit Timestamp” and then change the date and time to the time when you want to be actually published. Click “Publish”, and then….well, that’s it. You are done. It will look something like this (the post will be published on Feb 26, 9:30 AM):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="/img/uploads/wordpress_future_post_time2.png" alt="Wordpress_future_post_time2">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, you are indeed keeping up with the modern times, you say, and are using cool desktop client tools, e.g. ,I use BlogJet (and that too over linux, read &lt;strong>&lt;a href="/2008/01/29/blogjet-blog-faster-blog-better-now-in-linux-too-with-a-hidden-bonus.html">this&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> for more). So what can we do about that. Its pretty simple really, almost the same thing. Again, look in the lower left corner, and you see:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="/img/uploads/blogjet_future_post_time1.png" alt="Blogjet_future_post_time1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Obviously, you are intelligent enough to modify it to look like this before pressing the lovely, earthy publish button:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="/img/uploads/blogjet_future_post_time2.png" alt="Blogjet_future_post_time2">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All set? No, there is one little difference in this method. When you are posting through a desktop client, the post time seem to be interpreted in GMT in WordPress, so you have to discount for that. e.g., as an example if my time zone is +6:00 wrt GMT, I have put in the time as 3:30 AM in BlogJet to achieve the same publish time (Feb 26, 09:30 AM local time).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hope this was easy enough for you. If it was, then don’t forget to spend the extra time on weekdays buying groceries and taking some burden off your wife/mom/etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**PS: **This post was future-posted as well, and through BlogJet, if you must ask.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Tips: Configure FTP upload support for wordpress in Blogjet</title><link>/2008/02/07/tips-configure-ftp-upload-support-for-wordpress-in-blogjet/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Feb 2008 14:36:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2008/02/07/tips-configure-ftp-upload-support-for-wordpress-in-blogjet/</guid><description>A few days ago, I had written about a wonderful blogging tool Blogjet.

Now, if you host a wordpress blog, you’d be aware of the fact that for wordpress to be able to upload yor files (images, attachements in post etc) to the server, you have to make the upload directory writable by all. Now, this is a BIG security risk. Some people go to the lengths of CHMOD’ding their upload directory for a short while and after upload, restoring the apt file permissions back. Some upload their files separately through ftp. But Blogjet has a very cool feature. It supports uploading all your non-text content to your webspace not only by using wordpress APIs but also through ftp if wordpress doesn’t have necessary permissions to write files on your server. This saves you a lot of time, that you can then devote on writing the actual post instead of meandering around with the “technicalities”. But many a people have a heart-ache configuring the ftp with Blogjet, although it is quite simple really. This is basically due to conflicting and confusing instructions existing on the ‘net. So, here I present to you step by step, simplest instrutions to configure this. Read on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step1) Launch Blogjet. You will be presented with a login screen (shown below). You can create a new account or choose to edit an existing one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="/img/uploads/1_blogjet_login_screen.jpg">&lt;img src="/img/uploads/1_blogjet_login_screen_thumb.jpg" alt="1_blogjet_login_screen">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step2) Choose “I have a blog” on the next screen. Press next.(You might not get this screen if you are editing an old account. In that case, skip to Step 3)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="/img/uploads/2_blogjet_create_blog.jpg">&lt;img src="/img/uploads/2_blogjet_create_blog_thumb.jpg" alt="2_blogjet_create_blog">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step3) In the “Edit connection Settings” dialog, click on “Configure Settings Manually”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="/img/uploads/3_blogjet_settings.jpg">&lt;img src="/img/uploads/3_blogjet_settings_thumb.jpg" alt="3_blogjet_settings">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step4) In the Connection settings dialog, there are two options for wordpress blogs. “Wordpress” and “Wordpress (Direct Upload)”. Choose “Wordpress”. The direct upload feature is for people whose wordpress installations have necessary permissions to create files on the server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="/img/uploads/4_blojget_account_settings.jpg">&lt;img src="/img/uploads/4_blojget_account_settings_thumb.jpg" alt="4_blojget_account_settings">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step5) Enter the username and password for your blog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="/img/uploads/5_blogjet_username.jpg">&lt;img src="/img/uploads/5_blogjet_username_thumb.jpg" alt="5_blogjet_username">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step6) Now, you get the FTP Configuration screen. Check out the image below and then read the instructions for filling up various columns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="/img/uploads/6_blogjet_config_ftp.jpg">&lt;img src="/img/uploads/6_blogjet_config_ftp_thumb.jpg" alt="6_blogjet_config_ftp">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i) Tick the checkbox which says “Use FTP to upload pictures…..”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ii) FTP Server: ftp address for your server. e.g.: &lt;a href="ftp://ftp.mysite.com/">ftp.mysite.com&lt;/a> .If you don’t know this, then you should contact your webhost support staff to know about this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>iii) Port: Generally ftp port is 21. However, if you are not sure, then ask your webhost support staff to get the exact number.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>iv) Remote Folder: This is the folder where you want to upload your stuff but is relative to the path where your ftp connection lands you. You’ll need to make a manual ftp connection to your ftp server first to check this. Check the examples after next step.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>v) Base URL: This is the complete web path, that wordpress (or any user over the web) will use to access the image.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Examples: If your ftp server address is &lt;a href="ftp://ftp.mysite.com/">ftp.mysite.com&lt;/a>, and your wordpress blog address is &lt;a href="http://blog.mysite.com/">http://blog.mysite.com&lt;/a> . Your file directory structure is something like given below:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>/public_html -&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>/public_html/wordpress&lt;/p>
&lt;p>/another_folder&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you connect to ftp manuall, you land up at “/”, you make a new folder at /public_html/wordpress/uploads, where you are going to upload your files. And your blog address &lt;a href="http://blog.mysite.com/">http://blog.mysite.com&lt;/a> points at /public_html/wordpress/ when you go to it through your web browser, then your field values will be:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remote Folder: /public_html/wordpress/uploads&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Base URL: &lt;a href="http://blog.mysite.com/uploads">http://blog.mysite.com/uploads&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notes: So, basically what you can do is for remote folder, connect to ftp, “cd” to the folder where you want to upload and do “pwd”, this is your remote folder address. For Base url, find out, where your blog address points to (take help of your webhost support if u need), then find your upload folder’s path relative to it, and add that relative path in front of your blog address.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>vi) Username/password: This is your ftp username and password given to you by your webhost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>vii) Now, click on “Test this configuration”. If everything is ok, then you’ll get a “FTP Configured properly” message as shown below. Then click ok and next.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="/img/uploads/7_blogjet_ftp_configured.jpg">&lt;img src="/img/uploads/7_blogjet_ftp_configured_thumb.jpg" alt="7_blogjet_ftp_configured">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step7) Click on finish. You are done. &lt;img src="/img/uploads/smile1.gif" alt="">. Do let me know if this worked for you or you had any issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="/img/uploads/8_blogjet_finish.jpg">&lt;img src="/img/uploads/8_blogjet_finish_thumb.jpg" alt="8_blogjet_finish">&lt;/a>&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>BlogJet - Blog Faster, Blog Better (Now In Linux too, with a hidden bonus)</title><link>/2008/01/29/blogjet-blog-faster-blog-better-now-in-linux-too-with-a-hidden-bonus/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jan 2008 15:30:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2008/01/29/blogjet-blog-faster-blog-better-now-in-linux-too-with-a-hidden-bonus/</guid><description>A quick googling for best desktop blogging client would yield just a few (read millions/gazillions) results.

&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>In fact, the current crop of Linux based blog clients is at best childish, compared to these. A piece of software called &lt;a href="http://www.larryborsato.com/bleezer/">Bleezer&lt;/a> did offer a good set of features and supported linux as well, but turned out it was so crash-y, hogged up enormous amounts of ram, and had other issues that come usually packed with all java apps. But I wasn’t gonna boot into WinDUHs, just for one sole software, was I?? Sure, I wasn’t &lt;img src="/img/uploads/smile1.gif" alt="">. I tried the usual routine of trying to run them through wine but it wasn’t supported. I resorted to my faithful ol’ google, and chanced across &lt;a href="http://www.thetechandcents.com/2007/11/running-zoundry-blog-editor-under-wine.html">this little nugget&lt;/a>, with step by step instructions to achieve my goal. And it had a bonus. It told me about &lt;a href="http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/page/Main_Page">IEs4Linux&lt;/a> (IE’s For Linux). yes, you read correctly. You can run Internet Explorer on your Linux box as well. All this in under 10 minutes (Ubuntu wins again). And yeah, don’t forget to say thanks to me (and &lt;a href="http://www.thetechandcents.com/2007/11/running-zoundry-blog-editor-under-wine.html">Alex&lt;/a> as well).&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
