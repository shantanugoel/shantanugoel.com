There are many flashlight apps on the Android Market Place but none of them will work for you if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a rooted phone. BUT this changed recently. I use a brilliant app called &amp;ldquo;quick settings&amp;rdquo; which keeps an icon in the notification bar and I can pull it down and change any settings without leaving other apps.</description></item></channel></rss>
