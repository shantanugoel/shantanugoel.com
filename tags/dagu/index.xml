Being stuck at home and having a few pieces of joy around made me do this over the weekend.
Ingredients:
An old Toy RC car broken out of shape by my 4 year old
DAGU Mini Driver
Screw Driver/Batteries/Tape/Glue/Rubber bands/Old gift cards
Half an hour of coding
Output:
A car that runs automatically making 8 shape on the floor (More like random fractals due to the wheels having no grip)</description></item></channel></rss>
