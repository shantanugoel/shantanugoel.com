Well, you can change that. Plus, all you windows-to-linux converts must also be thinking of how to squeeze in a few more windows into the task bar. A &amp;ldquo;grouping of similar windows&amp;rdquo; option like windows would have been just nice.

&lt;p>Well, you can change that. Plus, all you windows-to-linux converts must also be thinking of how to squeeze in a few more windows into the task bar. A &amp;ldquo;grouping of similar windows&amp;rdquo; option like windows would have been just nice. Well, that can be done too, and without any shell scripting, config file modifying, etc. It&amp;rsquo;s all in the GUI for a change &lt;img src="/img/uploads/smile1.gif" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All you need to do is:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Right click on the window list area, as shown by the red ellipse mark in the figure and click on &amp;ldquo;preferences&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="/img/uploads/titlebar2.jpg">&lt;img src="/img/uploads/titlebar2_thumb.jpg" alt="Titlebar2">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>You will get a window as shown below. Now, in the options marked by the black ellipse, you can choose the grouping option for the windows that you open to get more space and a windows like effect.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="/img/uploads/window_list_pref1.jpg">&lt;img src="/img/uploads/window_list_pref1_thumb.jpg" alt="Window_list_pref1">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>If you click on the &amp;ldquo;size&amp;rdquo; tab, you can modify the &amp;ldquo;maximum&amp;rdquo; width value to control how much space any window title can take on the title bar. You can also specify the minimum width if you wish to.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="/img/uploads/window_list_pref2.jpg">&lt;img src="/img/uploads/window_list_pref2_thumb.jpg" alt="Window_list_pref2">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>Click Close and you are done. Now, wasn&amp;rsquo;t that easy. Here is a screenshot of how that window title we saw in the first pic looks after this change.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
