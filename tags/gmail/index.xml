So I fired up pidgin within my virtual box installation at work (as I have only a 64 bit machine at home) but couldn&amp;rsquo;t get it to connect. Tried all sorts of methods found over the net of changing ports etc, set port forwarding in Virtual Box NAT, even switched to using a bridged host interface but still no go.</description></item><item><title>Gmail Blocking Messages to Yahoo Groups?</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/13/gmail-blocking-messages-to-yahoo-groups/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2008 16:58:36 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/13/gmail-blocking-messages-to-yahoo-groups/</guid><description>For the past couple of days I have been unable to send any mails to any of my yahoo groups through my gmail account.

The power to be all-seeing but yet still remaining unseen. Yes, now you can be “invisible” in your gmail chat session.
But beware, don’t fire up your gtalk, or you will again be as visible as a 100 watt bulb in a 4x4 room at night.</description></item></channel></rss>
