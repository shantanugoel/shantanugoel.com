So I fired up pidgin within my virtual box installation at work (as I have only a 64 bit machine at home) but couldn&amp;rsquo;t get it to connect.

The power to be all-seeing but yet still remaining unseen. Yes, now you can be “invisible” in your gmail chat session.
But beware, don’t fire up your gtalk, or you will again be as visible as a 100 watt bulb in a 4x4 room at night.</description></item></channel></rss>
