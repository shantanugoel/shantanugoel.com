&lt;p>A user going by the remarkably simple handle &amp;ldquo;email123&amp;rdquo; announced on the &lt;a href="http://xda-developers.com/">xda-developers &lt;/a>forum, that WM6.1 is here, alive and kicking. But he doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop there, he says that its available &amp;ldquo;now&amp;rdquo;, that too for an HTC wizard, a 3 year old phone (which I own as well). Thats not all, he goes on to provide the proof by linking in his cooked ROM for all to download. But, here is the clincher, he claims that finally &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://www.google.co.in/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=htc+big+storage+hack&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;amp;meta=">Big Storage&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo; is available for wizard, a feat noone has been able to achieve in the last 3 years. It means that an extra 10 MB is available to you as Device Memory. It seems to get better and better for our dear old wizard. After all, old is gold.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Click &lt;a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=364066">here&lt;/a> to go to the thread, the link is in the first post.

&lt;p>For the very post of this blog, I chose a subject that&amp;rsquo;s close to my heart. Yes, its Windows Mobile. My trusted 900/1800 MHZ companion for the past couple of years is an HTC Wizard. If you have ever looked into the WinMob world, its pretty much common knowledge that HTC owns the 95% of market share of this niche little space. They are a huge organization and with huge profits and they do make jolly good phones. BUT it is not the quality of phones that helped them reach this height. Its their business plan. &amp;ldquo;Always keep the customers craving more&amp;rdquo; seems to be the motto of this taiwanese giant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each phone seems to give one extra &amp;ldquo;feature&amp;rdquo; (read UI enhancement) over the latter. With Kaiser, it seemed too good to be true, getting a one in all phone. And it indeed was. As I pointed out &lt;a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=1767873&amp;amp;postcount=389">here&lt;/a> , it finally turned into a reality against all hopes of fellow WinMo owners, and HTC &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/01/25/htc-further-responds-to-video-driver-issue-will-improve-future/">declared&lt;/a> that nothing is coming for the current crop. So, am writing this post just to put in my two bits to the cause of these drivers, if you can do anything about it, take a look &lt;a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=351986">here&lt;/a> (and yeah, a 5000$ bounty awaits you as well)&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
