Whatever new service you sign on for on the internet (especially the web2.0–oh-so-cool-you-have-to-tell-everyone-about-it ones), it gives you an option to fill in your e-mail ID and password and makes a generous offer of letting all your friends know about your new avatar and let them all join in the fun. Most of the people around me, it seems, don’t think twice before gladly accepting the offer, as is made apparent from the increasing amount of automated mails I’m getting with subjects like “Hey, don’t be left out!</description><content>&lt;p>For the past many years, I’ve seen a trend that has been on a meteoric rise. Whatever new service you sign on for on the internet (especially the web2.0–oh-so-cool-you-have-to-tell-everyone-about-it ones), it gives you an option to fill in your e-mail ID and password and makes a generous offer of letting all your friends know about your new avatar and let them all join in the fun. Most of the people around me, it seems, don’t think twice before gladly accepting the offer, as is made apparent from the increasing amount of automated mails I’m getting with subjects like “Hey, don’t be left out! Join me on X” or “Hi SG, Why don’t you follow me on Y”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I just wanted to “remind” you all (because you already know it) how important your password is. You keep it safe from everyone, suspect even your friends of trying to hack into your e-mail, and then you give it away to an “unknown” entity with so much of ease, laying so much trust onto it that you won’t even put in your biological parents.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While many of these services are genuine, but many might not be. I’m certainly against handing out your passwords to a third-party web service until it is something like google that won’t just sell you off one fine day and run off somewhere you can’t find it. But if you are compelled to do so because of some reason, I’d recommend atleast checking out what it has to say about the data it’s collecting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let me take an example of a new IM service that I recently came across. It’s called IMO (or imo or whatever) and is apparently quite popular because of its multiple IM service connections through a single interface. I thought of checking out its terms etc and making a mental image of how respectable / trustworthy I found it. I had listed the following things on the blog where I had found about this site. Listing them here again for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following are the nuggets I found:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>1.&lt;/strong> They have a blogspot blog. It takes hardly a few minutes to host ur own blog on ur own domain. Maybe they have some existing google connection but yet to discover it.(I read somewhere that some of these people worked at google in the past but that’s no reason to keep your blog on such a platform)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2.&lt;/strong> Shady privacy agreement.
** 2a** They mention that not only will they save ur username and pwd but may also save ur chats/messages etc.
** 2b** They might also share info with 3rd parties (written in a manner that they can do it on their own will)
** 2c** Transparency: They might not even tell u whats going on if they so decide.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please don’t mention about the eliteness of their “advisor panel”. This is the biggest marketing gimmick that everyone pulls off. Many times the &amp;ldquo;advisors&amp;rdquo; don&amp;rsquo;t even know the &amp;ldquo;advised&amp;rdquo; company exists.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>IMP:&lt;/strong> If a site doesn’t say anything or says all goody things in its terms, that doesn’t make it clean, but if you find suspiciousness in the terms, that definitely makes a negative mark. &lt;strong>In Short, when your password is concerned, treat everyone guilty until proven innocent.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>TIP: Automating Website Backups - Part III (Cron Made Easy)</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/04/tip-automating-website-backups-part-iii-cron-made-easy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2008 04:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/04/tip-automating-website-backups-part-iii-cron-made-easy/</guid><description>The question that we will be answering today is: **Q2: **Cron?

Using tar, making up the script file is enough command line for me. Isn’t there an easy way? &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crontab">Cron&lt;/a> is a tool that can schedule any kind of tasks for you, and here we are using it to run our backup script automatically, so that we can concentrate on blogging. Now, most of us are phobic of anything that has anything to do with command line. And we already have enough of command line stuff in this &lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/17/tip-automating-website-backups.html">series&lt;/a>. So, you can breathe a sigh of relief for a few moments because atleast the cron part can be made Web/GUI based for you (The command line method for cron was given in the &lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/17/tip-automating-website-backups.html">first part&lt;/a>). The details that I’m going to present here are relevant for cpanel but it might differ for you (very minor to very major) as your webhost might have a different panel for you (e.g. vdeck) or even your cpanel might look very different. But the basic concept remains the same and with a bit of common sense, you can apply this concept to your site easily.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Step1) Look for some option in your control panel, which says something on the lines of “cron”, “cron job” or such. e.g.:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/automating_website_backups_cpanel1.png">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/automating_website_backups_cpanel1_small.jpg" alt="Automating_website_backups_cpanel1">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step2) If you get a screen as shown below, choose the experience level as “Standard” (maybe “novice” or similar in your panel). After all, we are using it because we want to avoid that unixy-command-line-stuff &lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/smile3.gif" alt="">.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/automating_website_backups_cpanel2_cron.png">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/automating_website_backups_cpanel2_cron_small.jpg" alt="Automating_website_backups_cpanel2_cron">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step3) You will get a screen as shown below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/automating_website_backups_cpanel3_cron.png">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/automating_website_backups_cpanel3_cron_small.jpg" alt="Automating_website_backups_cpanel3_cron">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, fill in the e-mail ID to which you want the script output to be sent to. (e.g. tar will output the list of files that were backed up) (e.g. &lt;a href="mailto:myemail@mysite.com">myemail@mysite.com&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, give the “&lt;strong>full&lt;/strong>” path (yes, starting from the root “/”) to your script that has to be run (e.g. /home/myusername/backup/backup.sh)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, choose the periodicity/time when this script has to be run, e.g., here we have chosen the script to be run everyday at 10:00 PM. **IMPORTANT: **Note that the time given here is GMT, so add your timezone offset. Generally, you should select a time when you expect the load on your website to be the lowest. e.g. I have selected a time of 3:00 AM everyday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Press “save”, “done”, “add’’ or whatever similar button you can find and it’s over &lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/smile1.gif" alt="">. That was easy innit?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s it for today. Lemme know if you have any doubts, or if you would like to see any other questions answered in this series. The question that will be answered next time (in “hopefully” the last part of the series) is:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q3:&lt;/strong> Well, backup is all hunky-dory. Now, how do I restore?&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
