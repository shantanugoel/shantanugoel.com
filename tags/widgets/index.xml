For normal applications, it is quite simple as when you press &amp;ldquo;debug&amp;rdquo; on the eclipse toolbar, it launches the emulator (or connects to existing emulator/device), syncs your application and launches its main activity and puts the control in your hands if you have put a breakpoint. For widgets, it seems a bit tricky because there is no activity to be launched, so eclipse just syncs your widget&amp;rsquo;s apk and installs it and that&amp;rsquo;s it. So, is it possible or not to debug widget code? and if yes, then is it very difficult? Fortunately, it is possible and very easy to do but just slightly less intuitive and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any information about it at Android developers website and learnt it by just fumbling around for a few minutes so thought of posting here for the benefit of other newbies like me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, all you need to debug your widget code is almost same as what you do for normal applications. Just follow the below steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Press &amp;ldquo;debug&amp;rdquo; on the eclipse menu (or &amp;ldquo;run&amp;rdquo; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to matter)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Once the widget apk is sync&amp;rsquo;ed and installed onto your emulator/device, switch your eclipse workspace to DDMS mode. You can either do this by pressing the &amp;ldquo;DDMS&amp;rdquo; labeled button on your top right corner or if you can&amp;rsquo;t find it, then do it by going to &amp;ldquo;Window-&amp;gt;Open Perspective-&amp;gt;DDMS&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Select the process name of your widget from the list of processes shown. By default, this list appears at top left of DDMS window. (See screenshot below). If you can&amp;rsquo;t see your widget&amp;rsquo;s process name in the list, it is possible that the widget is not added to the home screen yet. So, do so.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Press the green debug button above the process list (See screenshot below)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>And that&amp;rsquo;s it. Now, if you had put a breakpoint in the code, do something that executes that piece of the code.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>Let me know if this helped you out or if you see anything that I missed out. Happy coding :)&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>My First WordPress Plugin: Please Welcome shantz-wp-qotd</title><link>/2008/02/10/my-first-wordpress-plugin-please-welcome-shantz-wp-qotd/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Feb 2008 11:00:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2008/02/10/my-first-wordpress-plugin-please-welcome-shantz-wp-qotd/</guid><description>Motivated by Ronald’s ultimate wordpress plugin tutorial at devlounge, I decided that the best way to learn something is to use it in a live project.

Armed with my laptop and multiple flasks of coffee, the marathon began on Friday night. My only experience with web-related development so far had been around 8–10 years ago as a kid when, just like everybody else at that time, I was fascinated by HTML and did a “read-through” of HTML 4.0. But I have always been a believer of the theory that a C programmer can program in any language quickly without having to go through the whole manuals. Thus that night bore fruit for me, and by 5:30 in the morning I had a working “Quote of The Day” plugin at my hand with all the features I wanted it to have in its first avatar. Did a bit of polishing last night, fixed a few bugs, and created a readme, and here it is, Mr. shantz-wp-qotd “1.0”, in all its glory, ready for general consumption.&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Add quotes to all your posts automatically.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>

&lt;/li>
&lt;li>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>== Installation ==&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Shantz-WP-QOTD plugin can be installed in following easy steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Unzip &amp;ldquo;shantz-wp-qotd&amp;rdquo; archive and put all files into your &amp;ldquo;plugins&amp;rdquo; folder (/wp-content/plugins/). It is advisable to create a sub directory into the plugins folder, like /wp-content/plugins/shantz-wp-qotd/&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Activate the plugin&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Go to Options &amp;gt; Shantz WP Quotes, adjust your settings and save them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>For adding and configuring widget to sidebar, go to Presentation &amp;gt; Widgets.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>== Frequently Asked Questions ==&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>= How to add quotes anywhere in the posts/pages? =
Use the tag &lt;code>&amp;lt;!-- shantz-wp-qotd {option} --&amp;gt;&lt;/code> anywhere in your post (without the quotes).
Note:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>{option} (including the braces) has to be replaced by the quote pattern that you want: qotd, qottd or r. qotd is quote of the day, qottd is quote of that day and r is random.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The tag has to be added using the code editor and not the visual editor, otherwise it will replace the &amp;lt;, &amp;gt; with their HTML equivalents.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>= How to use the custom separator/multi-line quotes? =
By default, if you leave the custom separator box blank, the plugin uses a newline character as the separator. However, if you have quotes that have multiple lines, you can change this to a tag of your choice, say [quote]. Now, in your quotes file (or quotes pasted in admin panel options) add this tag at the end of each quote and you are done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>= What is the format for saving quotes? =
In text box in admin page, as well as in the file, the quotes have to be saved as one on each line. Each quote is separate by newline.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>= Where is the file with quotes located =&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the get from file option, a file &amp;ldquo;quotes.txt&amp;rdquo; has to be present in the same directory where shantz-wp-qotd.php is residing. A sample quotes.txt has been given with this plugin (with some quotes from southpark, simpsons, matrix and deus ex)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>= I checked the option &amp;ldquo;exclude pages&amp;rdquo; but my pages are still displaying quotes =
Check your WordPress version. This option is effective only for Version 2.1 and above&lt;/p>
&lt;p>= How to upgrade to a new version =
Simply overwrite the old files with the new ones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>== Screenshots ==&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

The issue is that for many people viewing wordpress blogs using this theme, the right sidebar doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear on the right, but **below **the middle column main area.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t know this problem existed as I don&amp;rsquo;t use IE but when a friend mailed to let me know, I started hunting around for the solution.</description><content>&lt;p>The awesome &lt;a href="http://www.mangoorange.com/resources/i3theme/">i3theme&lt;/a> that this blog uses is a treat to the eyes, except to a lot of IE6 users. The issue is that for many people viewing wordpress blogs using this theme, the right sidebar doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear on the right, but **below **the middle column main area.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t know this problem existed as I don&amp;rsquo;t use IE but when a friend mailed to let me know, I started hunting around for the solution. Infact, found on the home page of i3theme, that the author acknowledged this bug and fixed it in v1.5, except the fact, that the fix doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. Because this blog was also using the same version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, not taking anything away from the author, who has done a wonderful job with the theme, I took it upon myself to fix it, and the solution turned out to be really simple.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first thing I noticed was the &amp;ldquo;tag cloud&amp;rdquo;. Since many of my posts are tagged &amp;ldquo;Windows Mobile&amp;rdquo;, this particular tag had become pretty big, so much so that it was being cut off by the left sidebar boundary. But when I viewed the site in IE, it showed the full tag, but the last 2 letters were jutting out of the left sidebar. which caused the middle area to shift towards right ever so slightly, nudging the right sidebar towards the bottom in the process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hmm, this was the reason that many people never see this problem because they may have a particularly balanced blog (or with shorter tags) where one particular tag does not go out of the boundaries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The solution as anyone can guess now is to keep that tag within its range. Now, I call my solution as a hack or a workaround because ideally, we should be able to create a method to make the tag &amp;ldquo;word wrap&amp;rdquo; inside the edges. But since I was unable to get this done, I chose a simpler way. Make the tag small enough so that it fits &lt;img src="/img/uploads/smile3.gif" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, how are we going to do this. Wordpress uses a template tag called &amp;ldquo;wp_tag_cloud&amp;rdquo; to generate the tag cloud. (Usage: &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, this tag takes, amongst various other parameters, the values for the largest and smallest font size used for the cloud. So, what all we have to do is find the tag and pass the appropriate parameter. So, without further ado, here are the steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Go to the path: &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->/wp-includes/widgets.php.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Search for the function &amp;ldquo;wp_widget_tag_cloud&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>change the call &amp;ldquo;wp_tag_cloud();&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;wp_tag_cloud(&amp;rsquo;largest=17&amp;rsquo;);&amp;rdquo;, without the quotes. You may need to expermient with the number you pass as argument according to your tags.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Now, save the file and reload the blog in any IE window and you are done. (Delete the cache first if you are using a cache plugin).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Let me know if this worked for you.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
