And this works out to be good for you as well as the webhost in the end. Now, why am I saying this all which should be part of a “Doing Business 101” course. Because, in this world of unprofessional webhosting, where people lure you with fool’s gold, promising everything unlimited and cutting you off with even the slightest of deviation from their “AUP” mumbo jumbo, there still exist good webhosts which promise you very little but are good enough to deliver on them and then some more.</description><content>&lt;p>A webhost that puts building relationships with customers before making money is definitely a good webhost. And this works out to be good for you as well as the webhost in the end. Now, why am I saying this all which should be part of a “Doing Business 101” course. Because, in this world of unprofessional webhosting, &lt;a href="/2008/01/28/looking-for-a-host-for-a-party-that-you-will-throw.html">where people lure you with fool’s gold&lt;/a>, promising everything unlimited and cutting you off with even the slightest of deviation from their “AUP” mumbo jumbo,  there still exist good webhosts which promise you very little but are good enough to deliver on them and then some more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had this experience with my webhost just a couple of days back. My site was being hammered by 100s and 1000s of visitors from stumbleupon, digg, linux.com, linuxtoday, lxer, lifehacker, etc all at the same time. Needless to say I ran out of my 15 GB monthly bandwidth in no time. So many visitors coming but finding a mundane “509 Bandwidth exceeded” error. Alas!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I mailed my host that I was willing to pay a bit more to get some more bandwidth per month so that this doesnt occur in the future. I woke up in the morning and found a one-liner reply in my box that made my day “&lt;strong>Increased monthly limit to 20 GB”. Without any charge.&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>Even though I was willing to pay&lt;/strong> and  had told them so. And already I’m paying a very measly amount for my hosting (20$ per year) so they are not retaining a BIG customer as well. I’m just a tiny fish. If that is not the sign of a good webhost then I don’t know what is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You must be curious who my webhost is (those of you already haven’t whois’ed it). Well, the host is &lt;a href="http://www.rvh.in/billing/aff.php?aff=021">Real Value Hosting&lt;/a>. Do visit them. We need to have more hosters like them.&lt;/p>

A google search is going to even confuse you further. As you wade into this enormous ocean, you will be wowed by the offers given by some of these hosts, throwing away 100&amp;rsquo;s of GBs (no less) of disk space and bandwidth running into terrabytes. Almost every software on earth in your one-click fantastico arsenal.</description><content>&lt;p>One thing that is most difficult to choose (after a dress for your girlfriend that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make her &amp;ldquo;look&amp;rdquo; fat) is choosing a webhost. A google search is going to even confuse you further. As you wade into this enormous ocean, you will be wowed by the offers given by some of these hosts, throwing away 100&amp;rsquo;s of GBs (no less) of disk space and bandwidth running into terrabytes. Almost every software on earth in your one-click fantastico arsenal. (plus they promise to do your dishes after you are through with the dinner too). All this and more for a measly 3.99, 4.99, 5.99 and such price. Your jaw already touching the floor, you make a quick dash for your wallet, flip out your credit card, and sign up for that &amp;ldquo;limited time&amp;rdquo; offer for unlimited webspace before it expires. You then laugh at your friend who got a measly 100mb for the same price. But, what gives? Even a 100 GB hdd costs me close to 40-50 bucks, then how come they are able to do it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is no great Indian rope trick around it. The answer lies in just one term &amp;ldquo;oversell&amp;rdquo;. Yes, they oversell their available disk space and bandwidth to the tunes of 10s to 1000s of times, knowing that an average user will never use it up. Even if you do, then your account will be mysteriously suspended for &amp;ldquo;violating the AUP&amp;rdquo;. The AUP practically bans you from doing anything. It is a blend of the most hideous legal jargon signing on which might be equal to bequething all your savings to the host and you will never even come to know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, this post is just meant to be a word of caution for you to stay away from all those big and small names, purportedly touted as the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; on gazillions of sites across the web, and think again. If its too good to be true, it probably is.&lt;/p>
