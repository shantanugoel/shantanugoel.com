&lt;p>The main changes are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Now you can use other 3rd party twitter bots with it to get updates through twitter since the official twitter bot is down since a long time and there are no chances of coming back soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You can also use it even when you are not &amp;ldquo;away&amp;rdquo; by specifying the status when you want it to work. (e.g. any, available, unavailable, invisible, etc. Use splert -h to see all available status types). As an example, you can use this to selectively talk to people when you are busy.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>(As usual, binary files as well as 32 bit and 64 bit ubuntu/debian deb packages are available)&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
