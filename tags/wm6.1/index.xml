Please redownload the below mentioned package. It now has Oxios Close as well as Oxios Hibernate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oxios developed a very useful tool for Windows Mobile (WM2003/5/6/6.1) called &amp;ldquo;Oxios Memory&amp;rdquo; sometime ago. On running it, it&amp;rsquo;ll flush your RAM (kind of) and recover substantial amounts of memory that can be used by the currently program. It is so good at this that many people run it regularly on their phones, and most of them want to run it in an automated mode (through a scheduler or a script). But the problem (so far) was that it generates a Message Box at the end for which the user has to press &amp;ldquo;OK&amp;rdquo; button to make it go away. There is no known way of disabling this message box and many attempts to work around it by scripting the &amp;ldquo;press OK&amp;rdquo; action have been very unreliable at best. Hence, it took it upon me today to remove this nagging problem and 5 minutes later we have a &amp;ldquo;clean&amp;rdquo; Oxios Memory.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>**Update: **Modified the &amp;ldquo;Oxios Hibernate&amp;rdquo; app as well on public demand.

&lt;p>Yes, no more nagging prompts :)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The newly launched [&amp;ldquo;Projects&amp;rdquo;] section is hereby inaugarated with a Windows Mobile Tool developed by me, called “[ShantzTodayChanger]”. This is a little tool for your Windows Mobile based phones (Compatible with WM5/WM6 but not WM2003) which will cycle ur today background or theme after a set interval of time. It has a lot of features and options that you can discover by reading the text below. And you can even use this options to achieve something other than changing wallpapers as well but that depends on your imagination. !&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/ShantzTodayChanger.jpg" alt="ShantzTodayChanger Config Screenshot">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A user going by the remarkably simple handle &amp;ldquo;email123&amp;rdquo; announced on the &lt;a href="http://xda-developers.com/">xda-developers &lt;/a>forum, that WM6.1 is here, alive and kicking. But he doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop there, he says that its available &amp;ldquo;now&amp;rdquo;, that too for an HTC wizard, a 3 year old phone (which I own as well). Thats not all, he goes on to provide the proof by linking in his cooked ROM for all to download. But, here is the clincher, he claims that finally &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://www.google.co.in/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=htc+big+storage+hack&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;amp;meta=">Big Storage&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo; is available for wizard, a feat noone has been able to achieve in the last 3 years. It means that an extra 10 MB is available to you as Device Memory. It seems to get better and better for our dear old wizard. After all, old is gold.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/Screen002.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/Screen002_thumb.jpg" alt="Screen002">&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/Screen003.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/Screen003_thumb.jpg" alt="Screen003">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
