They have a special gaming edition of Chip Insider which featured the project along with a 2 page interview of mine. If you buy chip, do look out for it on pages 46 and 47.

Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s new XBOX 360 accessory, kinect has made a powerful entry into the market, becoming the fastest selling gadget of all time. Looks like their &amp;ldquo;You are the controller&amp;rdquo; tagline is working. Of course, Sony&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;similar&amp;rdquo; accessory Move is selling well too but is far behind kinect adoption probably because nothing beats the lure of making something work with just &amp;ldquo;The Force&amp;rdquo; ;).</description></item></channel></rss>
