There are generally 3 scenarios for this in a project that needs auto-generated files:
An external pre-built tool generates files pre-compilation and then the generated files get checked in to the tree The tool is compiled in-tree but is again used to generate files pre-compilation and then check them into tree The tool is built during the main build step and then it also generates the needed files just in time.</description></item><item><title>Integrating SDL2 with bazel on macOS</title><link>/posts/sdl2-macos-bazel/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 02:01:05 +0530</pubDate><guid>/posts/sdl2-macos-bazel/</guid><description>Bazel Came across bazel build system recently at my new job and found it to be quite nice compared to my earlier mainstays CMake and Make. It&amp;rsquo;s fast and correct, just as their website says. But I also liked it because it&amp;rsquo;s explicit with very little magic. And it has a powerful query/tools system that allows you to really analyze your builds and dependencies in depth. Though examples in the wild are a bit less since it is a fairly recent entrant compared to its competitors.</description></item></channel></rss>
