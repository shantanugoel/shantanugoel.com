Using tar, making up the script file is enough command line for me. Isn’t there an easy way? &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crontab">Cron&lt;/a> is a tool that can schedule any kind of tasks for you, and here we are using it to run our backup script automatically, so that we can concentrate on blogging. Now, most of us are phobic of anything that has anything to do with command line. And we already have enough of command line stuff in this &lt;a href="/2008/02/17/tip-automating-website-backups.html">series&lt;/a>. So, you can breathe a sigh of relief for a few moments because atleast the cron part can be made Web/GUI based for you (The command line method for cron was given in the &lt;a href="/2008/02/17/tip-automating-website-backups.html">first part&lt;/a>). The details that I’m going to present here are relevant for cpanel but it might differ for you (very minor to very major) as your webhost might have a different panel for you (e.g. vdeck) or even your cpanel might look very different. But the basic concept remains the same and with a bit of common sense, you can apply this concept to your site easily.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Step1) Look for some option in your control panel, which says something on the lines of “cron”, “cron job” or such. e.g.:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="/img/uploads/automating_website_backups_cpanel1.png">&lt;img src="/img/uploads/automating_website_backups_cpanel1_small.jpg" alt="Automating_website_backups_cpanel1">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step2) If you get a screen as shown below, choose the experience level as “Standard” (maybe “novice” or similar in your panel). After all, we are using it because we want to avoid that unixy-command-line-stuff &lt;img src="/img/uploads/smile3.gif" alt="">.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="/img/uploads/automating_website_backups_cpanel2_cron.png">&lt;img src="/img/uploads/automating_website_backups_cpanel2_cron_small.jpg" alt="Automating_website_backups_cpanel2_cron">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step3) You will get a screen as shown below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="/img/uploads/automating_website_backups_cpanel3_cron.png">&lt;img src="/img/uploads/automating_website_backups_cpanel3_cron_small.jpg" alt="Automating_website_backups_cpanel3_cron">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, fill in the e-mail ID to which you want the script output to be sent to. (e.g. tar will output the list of files that were backed up) (e.g. &lt;a href="mailto:myemail@mysite.com">myemail@mysite.com&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, give the “&lt;strong>full&lt;/strong>” path (yes, starting from the root “/”) to your script that has to be run (e.g. /home/myusername/backup/backup.sh)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, choose the periodicity/time when this script has to be run, e.g., here we have chosen the script to be run everyday at 10:00 PM. **IMPORTANT: **Note that the time given here is GMT, so add your timezone offset. Generally, you should select a time when you expect the load on your website to be the lowest. e.g. I have selected a time of 3:00 AM everyday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Press “save”, “done”, “add’’ or whatever similar button you can find and it’s over &lt;img src="/img/uploads/smile1.gif" alt="">. That was easy innit?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s it for today. Lemme know if you have any doubts, or if you would like to see any other questions answered in this series. The question that will be answered next time (in “hopefully” the last part of the series) is:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q3:&lt;/strong> Well, backup is all hunky-dory.

Well, this is a short note further developing on the approaches discussed there. Basically, telling tar to backup only those files which have changed. For this, Linux has a command “find” which I am very fond of. You can give it a option “-newer” followed by a f”&lt;em>filename&lt;/em>” and it will return the names of the files that are newer than &lt;em>filename&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>So, the command given above will find all the files that have changed since you took the backup “&lt;em>backup_x.tgz&lt;/em>” and store those filenames and paths into “_files.txt”. _The “-type f” option makes sure that only filenames are listed and not directory names, because tar creates a lot of issues when presented with directory names (Explore yourself about this).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, all we have to do is give this “&lt;em>files.txt&lt;/em>” to tar as an input to tell it which files to archive.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The “-T files.txt” option makes this happen. Moreover, I have introduced 2 new options here, that were not present in our last part. They are:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>p – Tells tar to preserve file permissions&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>G – Tells tar to ignore any file read errors etc and continue&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Apart from this, you can also take a look at the “-mtime x” option for find command which lets you specify to list files which have changed in past x days. There are other similar options available for find. Look at “man find” and take your pick. Similar options exist for tar, but I have had a lot of weird issues using them, so I’d recommend sticking with this two step process of “find” followed by “tar”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, the above mentioned commands and options can be used in innumerous ways and combinations to achieve your perfect balance of space and ease of use etc for backups. I’ll list down a sample script here, that will make a full backup on every first day of the week, and then make incremental backups over each day for rest 6 days. So, you’ll save a lot of space (more than 5 times), but you will have to use all 7 backup files to make a full restore. (I’m listing just the backup part, you can add the “mutt” command yourself, for e-mailing as mentioned in &lt;a href="http://tech.shantanugoel.com/2008/02/17/tip-automating-website-backups.html">Part I&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>

So, thought of doing a few follow ups to that post. This is done in more of a FAQ fashion, so as to answer some of the questions that may arise after reading the first post. Each post will answer one of the questions listed below in detail&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Questions to be answered:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q1:&lt;/strong> I have strict limits on webspace/email attachment etc. Can anything be done to reduce the backup size?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Q2: **Cron? Using tar, making up the script file is enough command line for me. Isn’t there an easy way?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q3:&lt;/strong> Well, backup is all hunky-dory. Now, how do I restore?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Want the answers? Read on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q1:&lt;/strong> I have strict limits on webspace/email attachment etc. Can anything be done to reduce the backup size?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**A1: **Sure, we can do quite a lot about it. If your concern is just the webspace, and you want a very simple restoring process, you should be looking for reducing the number of backups that you save on the server, instead of reducing the size of the backup (you anyways have all the backups mailed out to you). The number of backups can be reduced by manipulating the command given in step 1 of the previous post. To recall, the command was:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Here, the &lt;code>date +%w&lt;/code> part ensured that at any time there will be 7 previous backups at max stored on the server (backup_0.tgz, backup_1.tgz,…). You can remove this part and every day your previous backup will be overwritten by the new one, thus using space for just 1 backup. And since you have all the backups emailed to you as well, you don’t need to worry about restoring back to any point in time. Its just that having the backup on your server saves some time if you do have to restore since you don’t have to upload the backup file onto the server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>BUT&lt;/strong>, if you must place restriction on your backup size (backup is so big that that your email can’t handle it as an attachment or you are really really pressed for webspace or backing up all the files takes up too much time/cpu of the host server), then you can save yourself by backing up only the files that need to be backed up. What does that mean? All CMS (Content Management Systems like Joomla, WordPress, Drupal, or your custom ones, or even a manually made site) will have some/many static components/files which don’t change with time, and so these files don’t need to be backed up every time. You can just backup the files that change or the ones that get added (like images, uploads etc).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, all you have to do is determine which files you &lt;strong>don’t&lt;/strong> want backed up, create a list for them and supply it to the _tar _command, with the _—exclude-from _option, and tar will dutifully avoid zipping those files up, leaving you with only the most needed files.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Now, there are two ways to go about determining which files you don’t need. First is that you simply run “&lt;em>ls -R &amp;gt; exclude_these_files.txt”&lt;/em> on the root of your home directory on the server (the folder beneath which your &lt;em>public_html&lt;/em> or &lt;em>www&lt;/em> folder resides). Then fire up your favourite editor and load this file into that and delete the file names from the file which you want to back up, leaving only those filenames in the file which you don’t want to backup. Generally, you would be interested in backing up any files that you have uploaded yourself onto the server (like images, archives, songs, any other files that you uploaded, any files that you modified, etc)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are not sure which files you should be backing up and you don’t want to backup all files, then there is still hope for you, but only if you are reading this guide before starting a new site &lt;img src="/img/uploads/smile3.gif" alt="">. Because then, before making any posts or customizations, you can just run the above mentioned &lt;em>ls&lt;/em> command, and you will have a list of the default files that are always there with your CMS and you don’t need to back them up. However, make sure that if you ever change any of the default files, do delete their names from the exclude_these_files.txt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s it for today. Lemme know if you have any doubts, or if you would like to see any other questions answered in this series. The question that will be answered next time is:&lt;/p>
