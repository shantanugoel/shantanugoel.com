The announcement for releasing the source code, licensed under GPL v2, was made on their forums. For the announcement and download details, click &lt;a href="http://forums.creative.com/creativelabs/board/message?board.id=soundblaster&amp;amp;thread.id=132288">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I guess this is a reason for us to rejoice because of two reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>This would definitely make life that much more better as the open source developers fix these particular drivers (ALSA people, start your engines)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>This also means another big inroads into the commercial world for open source as creative is definitely one of the big boys around.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Now, I wish NVidia would see the light of the day as well. Creative guys, care to take a trip down to Santa Clara to share your reasonings with our GPU brothers :)&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>All Your Base Are Belong To Us - Says Dell</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/01/30/all-your-base-are-belong-to-us-says-dell/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jan 2008 18:27:55 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/01/30/all-your-base-are-belong-to-us-says-dell/</guid><description>Ask any laptop user about how much he liked to kick some butt in Gears of War and he would cringe and cry with agony even before you are able to say the &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rdquo; of Crysis.

&lt;p>Ask any laptop user about how much he liked to kick some butt in Gears of War and he would cringe and cry with agony even before you are able to say the &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rdquo; of Crysis. But not anymore. For its notebook consumers, Dell has finally come up with the &lt;a href="http://direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2008/01/29/43163.aspx">perfect answer&lt;/a> to the questions posed by these ridiculously-difficult-to-get-more-than-10-fps games. Available now is some motherly love for your laps in the form of &lt;a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/geforce_8800m.html">8800M GTX &lt;/a>with its M1730. But that&amp;rsquo;s not all, it slaps onto the lappy not one, but two GFX cards in one. Yes, men, you heard that right &amp;ldquo;SLI&amp;rdquo; &lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/smile1.gif" alt="">.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And those who are just beginning to get those puddles forming around the corners of their eyes because they bought their M1730&amp;rsquo;s with the slightly retro 8700&amp;rsquo;s, Dell loves you as well, because you, my dear friends, get an option to upgrade to the latest and greatest as well (US only as of now, but would soon be offered to Europe, AP customers as well).&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
