If you use dropbox (A popular online storage service with free 2 GB space), and use (or intend to use) its public or shared folders feature, then you must know something about the EULA (End Users&amp;rsquo; LIcense Agreement). Yes, the one that you clicked &amp;ldquo;I Agree&amp;rdquo; on, without even reading one word of.</description><content>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update:&lt;/strong> In a &lt;a href="http://forums.getdropbox.com/topic.php?id=4207">thread about this post at Dropbox forums&lt;/a>, it was brought to my notice that Dropbox has now changed its &lt;a href="https://www.getdropbox.com/terms#terms">terms&lt;/a> to remove the objectionable clause.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you use dropbox (A popular online storage service with free 2 GB space), and use (or intend to use) its public or shared folders feature, then you must know something about the EULA (End Users&amp;rsquo; LIcense Agreement). Yes, the one that you clicked &amp;ldquo;I Agree&amp;rdquo; on, without even reading one word of. Basically, you need to know the following lines:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>While you own the content contained in Your Files, you hereby grant all other Dropbox users a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, perpetual and irrevocable right and license to use and exploit Your Files in your public folder. In addition, you hereby grant Dropbox users who have been given access to your shared folder a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, perpetual and irrevocable right and license to use and exploit Your Files in your shared folder.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>What this means is that anything you share with anyone through dropbox falls into almost-public domain. This includes any pics, docs, source code, etc. So, be warned and use the service with care and descrition. :) PS: I searched SpiderOak&amp;rsquo;s EULA for similar terms but it looks clean to me. Are there any other services that you know having such hidden gotchas? (Although we must admit they are not so hidden after all, but it is us who turn a blind eye towards the terms)&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>SpiderOak Promotion Code For Free Upgrade To 10 GB</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/09/12/spideroak-promotion-code-for-free-upgrade-to-10-gb/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2008 20:58:32 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/09/12/spideroak-promotion-code-for-free-upgrade-to-10-gb/</guid><description>Just a small shout out to let you guys know that you can use the discount coupon code “linkup” while signing up the excellent online backup service SpiderOak to get a major bump to 10 GB from the 2 GB that they give to normal accounts.
