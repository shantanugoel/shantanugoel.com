&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You can also use it even when you are not &amp;ldquo;away&amp;rdquo; by specifying the status when you want it to work. (e.g. any, available, unavailable, invisible, etc. Use splert -h to see all available status types). As an example, you can use this to selectively talk to people when you are busy.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

Send custom automatic replies to different people when they message you and came across a strange bug. It never sent the reply when you received the first message from someone. I was using the &amp;ldquo;ReceivedImMessage&amp;rdquo; signal over d-bus (or &amp;ldquo;received-im-message&amp;rdquo; for the plugin writers). What I found initially looked to be a gross and basic error by pidgin developers, but later found that it is indeed a good design and thought that I&amp;rsquo;ll make a post about it for the benefit of fellow pidgin plugin/app developers.</description><content>&lt;p>Recently I wrote a small autoreply-answering-machine app for pidgin with a simple premise.

What I found initially looked to be a gross and basic error by pidgin developers, but later found that it is indeed a good design and thought that I&amp;rsquo;ll make a post about it for the benefit of fellow pidgin plugin/app developers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a bit of debugging I saw that when I received the ReceivedImMessage signal for the first message, the &amp;ldquo;Conversation ID&amp;rdquo; field is not a valid value but 0. Thereafter, I got the correct value every time. Searching on the google didn&amp;rsquo;t reveal much except a few other people complaining about the same and someone saying that this is a bug because pidgin first sends the signal and then creates the conversation while it should be the other way round.Â  Fair enough. But then&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I came across a short explanation by a pidgin developer, seanegen, (sorry lost the link somewhere). Basically, the reason behind this is that all the checks (e.g. Blacklists etc) are performed after one gets this signal, and hence they dont create the window otherwise it might be created even if you have blocked the person who is sending you the message. Perfect explanation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, what&amp;rsquo;s the solution. Simple..Use the &amp;ldquo;DisplayedImMessage&amp;rdquo; (or &amp;ldquo;displayed-im-message&amp;rdquo; signal) which is sent, once the conversation has been created. That&amp;rsquo;s it. Hope that this post benefit you.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Hack: Pidgin-Gtalk Connection Problems - Get Around The Corporate Firewall</title><link>/2008/09/08/hack-pidgin-gtalk-connection-problems-get-around-the-corporate-firewall/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2008 15:30:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2008/09/08/hack-pidgin-gtalk-connection-problems-get-around-the-corporate-firewall/</guid><description>I recently wrote a simple answering machine program/plugin for pidgin and someone asked me to port it to 32 bit.

So I fired up pidgin within my virtual box installation at work (as I have only a 64 bit machine at home) but couldn&amp;rsquo;t get it to connect. Tried all sorts of methods found over the net of changing ports etc, set port forwarding in Virtual Box NAT, even switched to using a bridged host interface but still no go. On a whim, installed pidgin in the host, i.e., windows and still the same issue. Hmm, interesting.. But wait, gtalk client works, then what gives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, after a bit of snooping around, discovered that it&amp;rsquo;s a special funda that my company employs (and probably yours too) to monitor your IM conversations. The server talk.google.com was redirected to another server set up by my company that masquerades as gtalk server and tries to act as a &amp;ldquo;Man In The Middle&amp;rdquo; to hijack your connection and listen to everything while you live in the fantasy that since its an &amp;ldquo;SSL encrypted&amp;rdquo; connection, everything is secure. However, &amp;ldquo;fortunately&amp;rdquo; pidgin refuses to connect here (More details in the end)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But as they say, rules are meant to be bent and broken. Here, is a simple way 3-step procedure to circumvent around this.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Open up your gtalk account settings in pidgin and go to Advanced tab.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Check &amp;ldquo;Force old port&amp;rdquo;, uncheck &amp;ldquo;plaintext auth&amp;rdquo; and uncheck &amp;ldquo;Require SSL/TLS&amp;rdquo;. Also change &amp;ldquo;Connect port&amp;rdquo; to 443.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>main&lt;/strong> part: Go to an online nslookup service and do an nslookup for talk.google.com. Put the IP that you get in place of &amp;ldquo;talk.google.com&amp;rdquo; in the settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s it. Go and chat away. (or if you want to know the reasoning behind this, hit the link below)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>More Details:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Skip this if you want, only for the people who are interested, here are some details on why pidgin does not connect in this situation and how you can find out if your company is using this tactic.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>How pidgin tries to connect to gtalk servers is that first it makes a connection to talk.google.com and gets and verifies the certificate from there. Then it tries to connect to gmail.com. Now there can be various situations:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>1.
1. Its unable to complete the transaction in the first place because you didn't use the port 443, so firewall blocks it hence it can't communand tries to fallback to plaintext authorization which is not supported by google and hence it fails.
2. You chose correct settings to go around firewall but now after verifying certificate, it just keeps &amp;quot;connecting&amp;quot;. Basically, it passes through the talk.google.com phase and then tries to connect to gmail.com (don't know why) and gets stuck on this step because the company is masquerading the gtalk server but not the gmail server.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>Look for the following symptoms to see if your company is doing &amp;ldquo;something&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>1.
1. Do &amp;quot;nslookup talk.google.com&amp;quot; in your command prompt (not through web), then say you get an IP x.y.z.w. Now do &amp;quot;nslookup x.y.z.w&amp;quot; again in command prompt. Now you will get the real name of the server that is your company's. Can try this for other IM servers as well (e.g. yahoo)
2. When pidgin asks you to verify the certificate, don't take it lightly. Just fetch and see the certificate and it'll definitely be pointing to some other domain.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Enough fundas for today. Let me know if this helped you out or if you have your own techniques of finding and circumventing around such stuff.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Project: Splert - A Custom Answering Machine And More for IMs</title><link>/2008/08/18/project-splert-a-custom-answering-machine-and-more-for-ims/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2008 17:00:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2008/08/18/project-splert-a-custom-answering-machine-and-more-for-ims/</guid><description>Update Aug 25 2008: Updated to v0.02 and also added 32 bit package.

You must have heard of (or used) the auto-reply features given by today&amp;rsquo;s instant messengers that are sent to the ones messaging you while you are not at your desk. But those are one-size-fits-all kind of messages. So, I wrote this simple tool a few months ago to turn Pidgin, everyoneâs favourite multi-client Instant Messenger (works with gtalk, msn, yahoo, aim etc), into a customized answering machine (and more) when you are away from your computer.</description><content>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update Aug 25 2008&lt;/strong>: Updated to v0.02 and also added 32 bit package.

Basically it allows you to divide up your contact list into groups based on email IDs and execute actions based on when someone from a particular group messages you while you are away. e.g. For general friends, you can keep a message like âWill talk to you later when I come backâ, or if someone from office IMs you, itâll send them your phone number âCall me at XXXXXX if urgentâ. And if you boss is the one pinging you, you could direct the message towards your twitter account so that you get it as an SMS on your phone immediately.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Splert: Shantz Pidgin Away Alerts</title><link>/2008/08/18/splert-shantz-pidgin-away-alerts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2008 16:55:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2008/08/18/splert-shantz-pidgin-away-alerts/</guid><description>This is aÂ simple tool I wrote a few months ago to turnÂ Pidgin, everyoneâs favourite multi-client Instant Messenger (works with gtalk, msn, yahoo, aim etc), into a customized answering machine (and more) when you are away from your computer.

And if you boss is the one pinging you, you could direct the message towards your twitter account so that you get it as an SMS on your phone immediately.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Time is short, so here are the details:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Features:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Group based rule execution, each group can contain any number of email IDs&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Custom replies for each group.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Integrates with twitter and will forward the message to your twitter account (or send a direct message to some other account) if you so desire. (Temporarily disabled since Twitter has blocked their IM bot)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Runs as a separate process over d-bus instead of running as a pidgin plugin, so much lesser chances of crashing.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Prerequisites:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Pidgin &amp;gt; 2.4.1&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Linux&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Download:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Usage:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Unzip the attached package anywhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Either install using the deb package or just copy the splert binary and config.txt to a folder of your choice&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Modify the âconfig.txtâ file according to your needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Run splert. (or run splert -h for checking out the available options though you wouldnât need them most of the times)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Config File:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Config file fields and formatsÂ are explained fully in the sample config file included in the attached file. However, here is a very basic sample configuration:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>[Friends]
user = &lt;a href="mailto:foo@foo.com">foo@foo.com&lt;/a>
message = &amp;ldquo;Not Here. Will talk to you later&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[VIP]
user = &lt;a href="mailto:boss@boss.com">boss@boss.com&lt;/a>
message = &amp;ldquo;Got your message. Will Contact you asap&amp;rdquo;
twitter = 1
twitterto = my2ndtwitteracct&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>ChangeLog:&lt;/strong>
0.03 - Oct04 2008 -&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Added option to specify twitter bot id (e.g. &lt;a href="mailto:twitterspy@jabber.org">twitterspy@jabber.org&lt;/a>) using option &amp;ldquo;-t/-twitterbot&amp;rdquo;. However, you need to do any &amp;ldquo;extra&amp;rdquo; stuff manually. e.g. logging in using twlogin command with twitterspy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added option to specify the status when you want to send messages instead of just when being away. Use &amp;ldquo;-s/&amp;ndash;status&amp;rdquo; option to do this.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>0.02 - Aug25 2008 -&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Fixed bug where response was not sent for 1st message received&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added 32 bit package&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>0.01 - Aug15 2008 - Initial Version&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please let me know if you like it or found some issues with it. Also, let me know if you would like me to add any features to it.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
