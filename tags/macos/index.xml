Not just that, I like to version them too so I can go back in time to any point. git serves as a good tool for me for versioning wherever small data/text files etc are concerned and then I back this up with remote git servers like my own git server on a raspberry pi at home, a gitlab server and a github server.</description></item><item><title>Integrating SDL2 with bazel on macOS</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2019/12/31/sdl2-macos-bazel/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 02:01:05 +0530</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2019/12/31/sdl2-macos-bazel/</guid><description>Bazel Came across bazel build system recently at my new job and found it to be quite nice compared to my earlier mainstays CMake and Make. It&amp;rsquo;s fast and correct, just as their website says. But I also liked it because it&amp;rsquo;s explicit with very little magic. And it has a powerful query/tools system that allows you to really analyze your builds and dependencies in depth. Though examples in the wild are a bit less since it is a fairly recent entrant compared to its competitors.</description></item></channel></rss>
