If you want to view a pdf and you don’t have adobe acrobat (or any other pdf reader) installed, e.g., you are sitting in a cyber cage or at a friend’s place, you can still view it. Only thing you have to do is, just prefix the url to the online pdf with &amp;ldquo;http://www.scribd.com/vacuum?url=&amp;rdquo; and you’ll see a nice web interface rendering your pdf without having to install anything on your PC.</description></item><item><title>Ubuntu Nuggets: Window list settings in panel</title><link>/posts/ubuntu-nuggets-window-list-settings-in-panel/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Feb 2008 19:06:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/ubuntu-nuggets-window-list-settings-in-panel/</guid><description>I am pretty sure that all of you must be fed of that one windows taking up the whole task bar in the panel.

A &amp;ldquo;grouping of similar windows&amp;rdquo; option like windows would have been just nice. Well, that can be done too, and without any shell scripting, config file modifying, etc.</description></item></channel></rss>
