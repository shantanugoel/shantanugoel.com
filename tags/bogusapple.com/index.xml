Now, the problem is that Apple didn&amp;rsquo;t even register this domain. By design? To make sure that it fails? But if so, it was a very poor design decision because then anyone could have registered it and used it for benefit, like spreading malware or phishing attempts and what not.</description><content>&lt;p>So, I just came across a thread on apple discussion forums and it &lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4380270?start=0&amp;amp;tstart=0">seems like&lt;/a> that Apple has added a new feature in OS X Mountain Lion due to which it redirects a lot of web traffic to a domain called &amp;ldquo;bogusapple.com&amp;rdquo; to make sure that it is failing.

&lt;p>Anyways, the threat is averted for now because a good natured githubber, &lt;a href="https://github.com/blog/1099-jason-salaz-is-a-githubber">Jason Salaz&lt;/a>, registered the domain name and plastered a pretty generic webpage over there which doesn&amp;rsquo;t do much (except give him a bit of web traffic boost).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the map fiasco and then this, it looks like Apple is indeed slipping up and things are falling through the cracks. Let&amp;rsquo;s see what Tim Cook has to say about this.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
