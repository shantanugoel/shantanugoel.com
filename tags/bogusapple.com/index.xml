Now, the problem is that Apple didn&amp;rsquo;t even register this domain. By design? To make sure that it fails? But if so, it was a very poor design decision because then anyone could have registered it and used it for benefit, like spreading malware or phishing attempts and what not.</description></item></channel></rss>
