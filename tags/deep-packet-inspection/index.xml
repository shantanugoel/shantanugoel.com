It's often done without much sense to it. The goveernment/telecom bodies and courts sometimes tell the ISPs to block content instead of telling the same to the websites that host the content. Sometimes, the orders are to block certain urls and ISPs are over-enthusiastic in implementing the orders and block complete websites. It's all frustrating but it becomes enraging when you find out that the ISPs are messing with your traffic in a less than ethical way to implement this.</description></item></channel></rss>
