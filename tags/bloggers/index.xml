WordCamp is coming to India. And what's more, Matt is going to be there. (Yes, THE Matt. Oh My, you just don't believe me, do you. Fanboys, it is time to rejoice as I assure you this is THEMatt Mullenweg). It's going to be held on the 21st and 22nd of this Feb at Adobe, Noida (who are the main sponsors for this event).</description></item></channel></rss>
