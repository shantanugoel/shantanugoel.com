I knew about the cool feature that you can click on those little green dots on the right top corner of any widget and the widget will minimize to just a bar but just now discovered another awesome feature for the viewers of the wordpress based blogs using this theme. The feature is that you, the viewer, can reorganize the widgets on the left and right sidebars according to your preference, like move the “Pages” widget towards the top for convenient navigation through all the static pages in the site. All this through simple steps like -“&lt;strong>Click, drag, drop&lt;/strong>” and you are set. The other widgets will automatically move up and down to make space. And the clincher is that it will remember your preferences &lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/smile1.gif" alt=""> (actually the browser will remember, I think). So, whenever you come back to the site, you will see it the way you like it. Here is an example:&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>I am just in love with this theme.

Like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/titlebar1.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/titlebar1_thumb.jpg" alt="Titlebar1">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, you can change that. Plus, all you windows-to-linux converts must also be thinking of how to squeeze in a few more windows into the task bar. A &amp;ldquo;grouping of similar windows&amp;rdquo; option like windows would have been just nice. Well, that can be done too, and without any shell scripting, config file modifying, etc. It&amp;rsquo;s all in the GUI for a change &lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/smile1.gif" alt="">&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>I am pretty sure that all of you must be fed of that one windows taking up the whole task bar in the panel.

&lt;p>All you need to do is:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Right click on the window list area, as shown by the red ellipse mark in the figure and click on &amp;ldquo;preferences&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/titlebar2.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/titlebar2_thumb.jpg" alt="Titlebar2">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>You will get a window as shown below. Now, in the options marked by the black ellipse, you can choose the grouping option for the windows that you open to get more space and a windows like effect.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/window_list_pref1.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/window_list_pref1_thumb.jpg" alt="Window_list_pref1">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>If you click on the &amp;ldquo;size&amp;rdquo; tab, you can modify the &amp;ldquo;maximum&amp;rdquo; width value to control how much space any window title can take on the title bar. You can also specify the minimum width if you wish to.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/window_list_pref2.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/window_list_pref2_thumb.jpg" alt="Window_list_pref2">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>Click Close and you are done. Now, wasn&amp;rsquo;t that easy. Here is a screenshot of how that window title we saw in the first pic looks after this change.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
