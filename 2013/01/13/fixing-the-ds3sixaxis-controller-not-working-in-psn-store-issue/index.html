<meta charset=utf-8><meta name=viewport content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1"><meta name=description content="So, my wife got me a new slim PS3 today to replace my old YLOD&rsquo;ed phat (Yes, Awesome wife I know. And slim PS3 cuz I hate the looks of the new superslim). But, I digress. The issue at hand is that everything worked fine when I unwrapped it, hooked it up to the power and TV and switched it on. However, once I started the PSN store (or what is now called Sony Entertainment Network Store), nothing worked. I got the main screen/content of the store displayed but I couldn&rsquo;t move around in the store. None of the buttons on the DS3 worked. I hooked up my older sixaxis and still the same. The only thing I could do was to hit the PS button which would bring up a menu from where I could quit the store app and then again everything worked fine once I was out onto XMB or in any game or for any other feature not related to the store.

I suspected that it could be a bad coding issue on Sony&rsquo;s part where the store is trying to communicate over some ports and the thread blocks on not being able to (since I had the router firewall on and UPnP disabled) making it look like the controller isn&rsquo;t working. So, I turned on UPnP and rebooted the router but still the same issue.</p><p>But, ultimately I hit upon the solution by mistake. I kept a button pressed on the controller while the PSN store was starting up and there it was. I could now move around and use the store without any issues. So, that&rsquo;s the solution folks. Just keep a button pressed before starting the store app and keep it pressed till the main screen is fully loaded. I don&rsquo;t know how or why this fixes the problem and I&rsquo;m going to drop a mail to the Sony customer care after writing this blog post. I hope they fix this in the next update.</p></div></div></article></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>¬© 2024 Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>
