General # Apps to install:
Alipay Can pay for food, taxis, etc or even online payments. Didi (Chinese Uber) and Metro/Bus tickets are integrated. Don&amp;rsquo;t need their separate apps. Indian credit cards work. May trigger fraud alert on Alipay side. If so, they may ask you to send a photo of your credit card (with some part of number hidden) etc. Change iPhone account region to some country other than India to be able to install from app store.</description></item><item><title>Hong Kong</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/notes/travel/hongkong/hk/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/notes/travel/hongkong/hk/</guid><description>General # Transportation # Take an Oyster card for the metro Can be refilled only via cash.
