  General
  #

Apps to install:

Alipay

Can pay for food, taxis, etc or even online payments.
Didi (Chinese Uber) and Metro/Bus tickets are integrated. Don&rsquo;t need their separate apps.
Indian credit cards work.

May trigger fraud alert on Alipay side. If so, they may ask you to send a photo of your credit card (with some part of number hidden) etc.


Change iPhone account region to some country other than India to be able to install from app store. For Android, can install apk from internet.

Can switch back to India region after installation.




WeChat (Not preferred since it needs someone to invite you)
Baidu maps. Google maps are not that good (even if you make them work with vpn). Apple maps are passable if you can&rsquo;t understand Baidu maps.


  Transportation
  #


Airport to city taxi can be tricky

Easy to get Didi, but they may not be able to find you where you are at the airport, and hard to communicate since they only speak chinese.
Local taxi drivers will try to rip you off
Best to book a hotel shuttle or from klook etc


Otherwise didi is easy to book in the city, or from city to airport
Metro is easy to use and cheap


  Food
  #


Vegetarian food is not that common in Shanghai, but look for Buddhist restaurants or vegan restaurants.


  Shopping
  #


Very few people shop offline in Shanghai and everybody orders from TaoBao
Hard for foreigners to buy from taobao. May need help from a local.


  Attractions
  #


  Visa / Paperwork
  #


Need to physically visit Mumbai VFS to get visa.


  Data / Phone
  #


Physical sim available at the airport.

Google etc and most non-china sites/apps dont work on this until you connect a vpn


Google and all other non-china sites/apps will work on your roaming pack on home country sim
Can buy a HK sim/eSim as well to use locally which also works for google etc.


  Money
  #


Alipay is used everywhere. Not much cash needed but keep some for emergency if it doesn&rsquo;t work.
Credit card usage is not that common
