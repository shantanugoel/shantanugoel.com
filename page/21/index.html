The installation went fine, all over within less than half an hour and then the problems started. Here are the 2 main issues that I faced along with their solutions, in the hope that if someone else runs into same issues does not have to waste time (and hair) on it :)</p></div><div><a class="read-more button inline" href=/2009/11/08/grub-knetworkmanager-kubuntu-karmic/></a></div></article><article class="post on-list"><h2 class=post-title><a href=https://shantanugoel.com/2009/08/23/make-frets-on-fire-work-pulse-audio-pasuspender/>Making Frets On Fire Work With Pulse Aludio - pasuspender</a></h2><div class=post-meta><time class=post-date>2009-08-23</time><span class=post-author>Shantanu Goel</span></div><div class=post-content><p>I recently got hold of a Guitar Hero controller for my PS3 but the game still had some time to come so I tried it out on my laptop with Frets on Fire (rather FoFix).

Searching on the google, I came to know this is happening because of Pulse Audio as this application needs direct access to the sound devices and finally I came upon **pasuspender. **This little tool allows you to do that with ease.

Killzone 2 is a very different game as compared to the other run-of-the-mill FPS&rsquo;s out there. Now, I might not be the best player out there but I&rsquo;ve played my fair share of it. So, I thought of jotting down some quick points for the different classes, how to play them and how to make the most of them according to my opinion. I hope to make this a series where I would discuss the strategies for a class and its primary and secondary abilities and once all classes are covered, I&rsquo;ll probably touch upon the rest of the aspects of the game. Please read them and supplement them with real practice to see the benefits. And yeah, do not hesitate to point out the flaws if any and I&rsquo;d also love to hear about the tactics that you follow as well as KZ2 is a game where the element of surprise is very important which calls for unusual strategies many times ;).<br>So without wasting any more time, here is a really really basic set that you should follow:</p></div><div><a class="read-more button inline" href=/2009/08/09/killzone-2-tips-tricks-tactics-stategies-engineer/></a></div></article><article class="post on-list"><h2 class=post-title><a href=https://shantanugoel.com/2009/07/10/shutdown-asus-wl-500-w/>Easiest Way to Shutdown Asus WL-500W</a></h2><div class=post-meta><time class=post-date>2009-07-10</time><span class=post-author>Shantanu Goel</span></div><div class=post-content><p>If you are a proud owner of an Asus WL-500W wireless router (or maybe another one of the same series like wl-500g, wl-500gp, etc), then you know that this router has a very useful USB port with which you might have attached your external hard disk and have already offloaded all your downloding tasks to it, or maybe using it for various other purposes. Whatever maybe the reason, the main point is that because of this hard disk, now we cannot just turn off the power of the router any more. It has to be shut down gracefully like a PC. One way is to ssh/telnet to it and then give the &ldquo;halt&rdquo; command but then you have to switch on a PC specially just to turn off your router. Well not any more. I was looking for a better way to do this and just found out the simplest one. And if you are using Oleg&rsquo;s custom firmware then you are in luck too.
With the 1.9.2.7-g version of his firmware, oleg added a new feature with which if you press the **EZ Setup **button at the back of the router for 3 seconds, it executes a script &ldquo;/usr/local/sbin/ez-setup&rdquo;, if present. So, all you gotta do is create a new text file named &ldquo;ez-setup&rdquo;, and paste the following contents in it:</p></div><div><a class="read-more button inline" href=/2009/07/10/shutdown-asus-wl-500-w/></a></div></article><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__buttons><a href=/page/20/ class="button prev"><span class=button__icon>‚Üê</span>
