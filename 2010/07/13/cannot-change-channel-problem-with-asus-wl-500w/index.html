I moved to a new location which was totally jam-packed with other wi-fi networks using same channel as mine which was hampeing my connection. I tried for umpteen number of times. Changing the channel through the web configuration did not give any error but I found that it was still transmitting at channel 1. I confirmed by checking on the &ldquo;Status & Log&rdquo; page, checking the logs, and running &ldquo;wl status&rdquo; command through ssh and they all confirmed that it was transmitting at channel 1 only, no matter what I set it to in the configuration. I even opened an issue in the firmware project for the custom firmware (by oleg and lly) that I am using but they weren&rsquo;t able to help me as the wi-fi drivers are binary only.

The solution is that you should set the &ldquo;Bandwidth&rdquo; to 20 MHz in wi-fi configuration if you are using 802.11 G. If you set it to 40 MHz then it gets stuck somehow but as soon as I changed it to 20 MHz, I was able to see the channel change immediately after reboot. Here is the screenshot of the page where you can find this setting.</p><p><a href=/img/uploads/asus-wl-500-w-change-channel.jpg><img src=/img/uploads/asus-wl-500-w-change-channel-thumb.jpg alt></a></p></div></div></article></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>¬© 2025 Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>
