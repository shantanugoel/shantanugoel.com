<meta charset=utf-8><meta name=viewport content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1"><meta name=description content="Recently I came across a weird error while trying to run firefly itunes server (mt-daapd) on my router (Asus wl-500w). It had something to do with sqlite and gave a vague message &ldquo;Unable to open database file&rdquo;. After going bonkers for a short time, I solved it and this is how.
One of my hard disks crashed recently and unfortunately it was the one I had connected to my router to serve media to me all over the house (through PS3/laptop) or when I travel (through laptop/phone). I had all the data backed up but somehow didn&rsquo;t preserve the firefly server. I rebuilt the server from source using my own guide (Thank God I did it. I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to preserve my sanity finding all that out the hard way again.). But after doing all the installation and reconfiguration, it gave me a weird error &ldquo;unable to open database file&rdquo; every time and exited. I checked the permissions on the songs3.db file (in /opt/var/cache/mt-daapd for me) and made it writable by all but the issue persisted. I changed its ownership to the user under which firefly was running but the issue was still there. Finally I found that the server (or maybe its an sqlite thing) was trying to create a temp file in the cache directory for the transactions and since the user with which it was started, didn&rsquo;t own the directory it wasn&rsquo;t able to create the file in it.
