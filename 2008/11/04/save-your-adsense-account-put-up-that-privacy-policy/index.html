Hi,

The Google AdSense Team</p><p>Now why I wrote this post was that though almost every site I visit has adsense ads, but only a very miniscule fraction of them is abiding with this condition. Maybe they don‚Äôt know this because on my search, I came to know that this clause was added to google‚Äôs policy around March this year. I don‚Äôt know how much fuss is google is going to create over this but I‚Äôd rather be safe than sorry. Especially when it takes only a few minutes to create your privacy policy. To create yours with a few clicks, I came across a simple online template here: <a href=http://www.serprank.com/privacy-policy-generator/index.php>Adsense Privacy Policy Generator</a>. I too used it (with a few modifications) to create my own <a href=/privacy/>privacy policy</a>. You are free to use it to create your own.</p></div></div></article></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>¬© 2025 Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>
