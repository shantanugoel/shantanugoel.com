My site was being hammered by 100s and 1000s of visitors from stumbleupon, digg, linux.com, linuxtoday, lxer, lifehacker, etc all at the same time. Needless to say I ran out of my 15 GB monthly bandwidth in no time. So many visitors coming but finding a mundane “509 Bandwidth exceeded” error. Alas!</p><p>I mailed my host that I was willing to pay a bit more to get some more bandwidth per month so that this doesnt occur in the future. I woke up in the morning and found a one-liner reply in my box that made my day “<strong>Increased monthly limit to 20 GB”. Without any charge.</strong> <strong>Even though I was willing to pay</strong> and  had told them so. And already I’m paying a very measly amount for my hosting (20$ per year) so they are not retaining a BIG customer as well. I’m just a tiny fish. If that is not the sign of a good webhost then I don’t know what is.</p><p>You must be curious who my webhost is (those of you already haven’t whois’ed it). Well, the host is <a href="http://www.rvh.in/billing/aff.php?aff=021">Real Value Hosting</a>. Do visit them. We need to have more hosters like them.</p><p><em>Disclaimer: The link above is my affiliate link.
