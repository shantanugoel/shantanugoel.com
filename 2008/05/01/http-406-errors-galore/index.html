I generally use desktop clients (mostly blogjet, but also Windows Live Writer and Scribe Fire sometimes) to blog to my WordPress based blogs. Some months ago, I started getting &ldquo;Http 406: Not Acceptable&rdquo; error while posting a particular post. Tried posting through the WordPress inbuilt TinyMCE editor, but got the same result. A little bit of research told me that this was because the post contained some words that were considered harmful by the &ldquo;mod_security&rdquo; plugin for apache that had been installed by my host to prevent hacking attempts. The quick resolution was to include the following lines in my .htaccess:

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Sure enough, I put them in, published the post, and it worked. But since this meant opening up my site to the real hacking attempts, I commented them out and went about my work, occassionally turning them on as and when required.</p><p>But, a few days ago, after a server upgrade, the problem reared its head again, and in a more vicious manner. I started getting the dreaded 406 error again, and this time for any post, even a blank post, and through all clients. But this time, TinyMCE was working without issues. A little bit of looking around my site told me that the problem was that my desktop clients were not able to connect to my &ldquo;x mlrpc.php&rdquo; file which is responsible for taking care of all the remote api provided by WordPress. Trying to access it through any means provided the 406 error. My site&rsquo;s error log was filled with:</p><blockquote><p>An appropriate representation of the requested resource /x mlrpc.php could not be found on this server.</p></blockquote><p>Now, the xml rpc methods are used not just by WordPress but many other CMS&rsquo;s (like drupal, joomla, etc) and sure enough a quick search resulted in many similar reports for all the platforms. Enabling my previous mod_security options resulted in &ldquo;503: Server misconfiguration&rdquo; errors, complicating things further.</p><p>On seeing the error logs, I found that the server could not understand the options, and then I discovered that the mod_security had been upgraded to and it wasn&rsquo;t backward compatible with old options. Modifying the options to their latest counterparts also didn&rsquo;t work, as further wading through mod_security manual told me that now, its options cannot be overridden through .htaccess and can only be changed by the web admin.</p><p>I found that my host has basically blocked the x mlrpc.php file from being accessed at all instead of using proper rules for blocking only the attacks while allowing valid accesses. This was the problem that a huge number of people are also having and moreover they (like me) are not able to convince their hosts to switch to proper rules.</p><p>However, not all hope is lost. I have &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; this issue with a workaround for now. It is pretty simple really. Just rename your x mlrpc.php to something else (e.g. myrpc123.php) and also replace all references to it in your CMS with your new file name. You can use sed to automate this task. I used perl however:</p><p><code>perl -e 's/x mlrpc.php/myrpc123.php/gi' -p -i *</code></p><p>Now, the 406 errors should be gone. If this worked for you, or you had any issues let me know. Also, if you have any other workarounds/fixes of your own, do drop me a word.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> In the above article, please ignore the space between &ldquo;x&rdquo; and &ldquo;mlrpc&rdquo; as the mod_security rules prevent them from being in content also. Moreover, use some unique name for rpc file.</p></div></div></article></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>¬© 2025 Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>
