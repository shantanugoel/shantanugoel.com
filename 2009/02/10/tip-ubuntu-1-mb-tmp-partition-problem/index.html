Many of the applications, that he regularly used, were misbehaving. e.g., he couldn&rsquo;t play flash videos in firefox, downloads were failing, installation of new applications were failing, etc. Everything was giving errors of not enough disk space even though he had quite a few GBs left on his drive. A few of the error messages pointed out that there wasn&rsquo;t enough space in /tmp. And indeed, he was unable to store anything more than 1 MB inside this particular directory. After a quick look I found out the issue. Ubuntu had created another partition with /tmp being its mount point and its maz size was set to 1 MB.

Many of the applications, that he regularly used, were misbehaving. e.g., he couldn&rsquo;t play flash videos in firefox, downloads were failing, installation of new applications were failing, etc. Everything was giving errors of not enough disk space even though he had quite a few GBs left on his drive. A few of the error messages pointed out that there wasn&rsquo;t enough space in /tmp. And indeed, he was unable to store anything more than 1 MB inside this particular directory. After a quick look I found out the issue. Ubuntu had created another partition with /tmp being its mount point and its maz size was set to 1 MB.</p><p>A search told me that this occurs if you happen to run out of disk space on your root partition some time, so Ubuntu automatically limits the size of /tmp to squeeze as much out of the remaining space as it can. Ideally, original behaviour of /tmp should be restored once you recover some space but it doesn&rsquo;t happen. The solution? Well, it is pretty simple. Just follow these steps.</p><p>Step 1. Open up /etc/mtab in your favourite editor. e.g. gksudo gedit /etc/mtab</p><p>Step 2. Look for a line that looks something like below example and delete it.</p><p><code>overflow /tmp tmpfs rw,size=1048576,mode=1777 0 0</code></p><p>Step 3. Save the file and restart your computer. That&rsquo;s it.</p><p>Now, this problem might not just be Ubuntu specific though and might happen with other distros as well. So, if you come across such an issue, try out this solution.</p></div></div></article></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>¬© 2025 Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>
