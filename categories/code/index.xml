There are generally 3 scenarios for this in a project that needs auto-generated files:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>An external pre-built tool generates files pre-compilation and then the generated files get checked in to the tree&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The tool is compiled in-tree but is again used to generate files pre-compilation and then check them into tree&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The tool is built during the main build step and then it also generates the needed files just in time.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Arguably, the last method is usually the better one since it keeps friction to a minimum during development by always generating latest files according to any changes done locally and also prevents against the human error of someone foregetting to commit the separately generated files, or having a time period where the tree is out of sync because the generated files and hand written files were committed separately. There is a con as well that such files are not available for someone going through the code statically for understanding or debugging. But one could always couple both methods if so desired.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had a need to generate some files for a side project of mine recently and I thought of listing down the way I achieve this with bazel, particularly the last mechanism mentioned above. So, our (simplified) problem statement is:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Our primary code is in &lt;code>main.cc&lt;/code> which needs to include an auto-generated header file &lt;code>header.h&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>header.h&lt;/code> is generated by running a tool &lt;code>header_generator&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>header_generator&lt;/code> is built by compiling &lt;code>header_generator.cc&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We only want to run a single build step of building our primary target. Rest should happen on its own flowing through the dependency logic.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>To achieve this, we should move in the reverse dependency order. First, let&amp;rsquo;s define the straight forward target of &lt;code>header_generator&lt;/code>. This target does not have any dependency and can build standalonea as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>cc_binary(
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> name &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;header_generator&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> srcs &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> [&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;header_generator.cc&amp;#34;&lt;/span>],
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Next, we define a target that will generate our library that builds &lt;code>header.h&lt;/code>. If this was a hand-written or pre-generated file, the target would&amp;rsquo;ve been simply:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>cc_library(
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> name &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;header&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> hdrs &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> [&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;header.h&amp;#34;&lt;/span>],
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>But this file does not exist in our tree and so bazel wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know how to make sense of it. So, we replace the &lt;code>hdrs&lt;/code> field of the library with another target (&lt;a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/general.html#genrule">genrule&lt;/a>) instead, which generates a rule on the fly.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Bazel documentation: A genrule generates one or more files using a user-defined Bash command. Genrules are generic build rules that you can use if there&amp;rsquo;s no specific rule for the task.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>genrule(
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> name &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;generate_header&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> outs &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> [&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;header.h&amp;#34;&lt;/span>],
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> cmd &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;./$(location :header_generator) &amp;gt; $@&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> tools &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> [&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;:header_generator&amp;#34;&lt;/span>],
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>cc_library(
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> name &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;header&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> hdrs &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> [&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;:generate_header&amp;#34;&lt;/span>],
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This target runs the command specified in the &lt;code>cmd&lt;/code> property as a bash command. The command uses the tool label mentioned in the tools property to figure out any tools&amp;rsquo; targets that need to be built before running this. &lt;code>location&lt;/code> attribute is used to refer to the final compiled binary of the associated tool and then it redirects the output to the filename mentioned in &lt;code>outs&lt;/code> property.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, we just plumb this with our primary target normally, making it dependent on the target that contains the generated header file.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>cc_binary(
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> name &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;main&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> srcs &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> [&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;main.cc&amp;#34;&lt;/span>],
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> deps &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> [&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;:header&amp;#34;&lt;/span>],
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>With these set of rules, whenever I run &lt;code>bazel run //src:main&lt;/code>, bazel will first compile the &lt;code>header_generator&lt;/code> binary, then run this binary to generate &lt;code>header.h&lt;/code> file and finally compile &lt;code>main.cc&lt;/code> along with these depdenencies and then run the final binary.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Java "Object" in C++ using std::variant</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2020/04/27/java-object-cpp-std-variant/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2020 19:39:50 +0530</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2020/04/27/java-object-cpp-std-variant/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m going through this brilliant book, Crafting Interpreters, these days to learn more about how interpreters are built.

My attempts so far have been ameturish, as I&amp;rsquo;ve never had a formal CS course, and this looked useful to upskill my toolkit. However, the book implements the interpreter in Java (at least the first part, which I am going through now) and I&amp;rsquo;m trying to follow along in C++ instead since I don&amp;rsquo;t have much experience in Java, neither an inclination to learn it. In one of the chapters, the author uses a Java &amp;ldquo;Object&amp;rdquo; class to hold the literal values that may appear in the script being parsed by the interpreter. Java docs say that:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Class &lt;code>Object&lt;/code> is the root of the class hierarchy. Every class has Object as a superclass. All objects, including arrays, implement the methods of this class.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So, this threw a bit of a spanner in the works for me since C++ does not really have any equivalent class which all classes derive from. Going through the options available, I stumbled upon &lt;code>std::conditional&lt;/code> and &lt;code>std::variant&lt;/code> that could be of help. From cppreference:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>std::conditional&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Defined in header &amp;lt;type_traits&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>template&amp;lt; bool B, class T, class F &amp;gt;
struct conditional; (since C++11)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Provides member typedef type, which is defined as T if B is true at compile time, or as F if B is false.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>std::variant&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Defined in header &amp;lt;variant&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>template &amp;lt;class&amp;hellip; Types&amp;gt;
class variant; (since C++17)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The class template std::variant represents a type-safe union. An instance of std::variant at any given time either holds a value of one of its alternative types, or in the case of error&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;code>std::conditional&lt;/code> seems to be much more straight forward to use if you have only two types to choose from. But I needed more than 2 right now, and they could increase in future as well if I started supporting more types. Thus, I went with &lt;code>std::variant&lt;/code>. You can think of this as a safer version of a union. So, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how to achieve my goal of emulating a Java Object-like class using std::variant and the visitor pattern. Another thing I needed to do was to convert the value into a string, irrespective of which type it was, so we will see how I did that as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The code is pretty straight forward. First we declare a new type alias called &lt;code>Object&lt;/code>. This refers to an std::variant which can take std::nullptr_t, std::string, a double or a bool types.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> Object &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> std&lt;span style="color:#f92672">::&lt;/span>variant&lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;&lt;/span>std&lt;span style="color:#f92672">::&lt;/span>nullptr_t, std&lt;span style="color:#f92672">::&lt;/span>string, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">double&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">bool&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;gt;&lt;/span>;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Next we create a helper function that encapsulates our cute little trick to convert any incoming object into a string in C++ with minimal code.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">template&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">typename&lt;/span> T&lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;gt;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">static&lt;/span> std&lt;span style="color:#f92672">::&lt;/span>string VisitorHelper(T x) {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> std&lt;span style="color:#f92672">::&lt;/span>stringstream temp;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> temp &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span> x;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> temp.str();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now, we could create tons of boilerplate code using things like &lt;code>std::get&lt;/code>/&lt;code>std::get_if&lt;/code>/&lt;code>std::in_place_index&lt;/code> etc to start using our Object. But we want to be smart and avoid all this. So, we use a visitor pattern. You can read this awesomely simple &lt;a href="https://www.bfilipek.com/2018/06/variant.html">article&lt;/a> by Bartlomiej Filipek to understand your options better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We create a &lt;code>Visitor&lt;/code> struct which contains the overloads for the operator(), which will call the appropriate implementation based on the type of the value of our instance. You can create other operator overloads as well here if you need. Note that in all the cases we are calling our templatized VisitorHelper which helps in converting the value to a string and return that.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">struct&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">Visitor&lt;/span> {

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;null&amp;#34;&lt;/span>;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> };
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> std&lt;span style="color:#f92672">::&lt;/span>string &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">operator&lt;/span>()(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">double&lt;/span> x) &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">const&lt;/span> { &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">VisitorHelper&lt;/span>(x); }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> std&lt;span style="color:#f92672">::&lt;/span>string &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">operator&lt;/span>()(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">bool&lt;/span> x) &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">const&lt;/span> { &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">VisitorHelper&lt;/span>(x); }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> std&lt;span style="color:#f92672">::&lt;/span>string &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">operator&lt;/span>()(std&lt;span style="color:#f92672">::&lt;/span>string x) &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">const&lt;/span> { &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">VisitorHelper&lt;/span>(x); }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>};
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>We can then &amp;ldquo;visit&amp;rdquo; the appropriate overload depending on the value with which it is called like so:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>std&lt;span style="color:#f92672">::&lt;/span>visit(Visitor{}, literal_);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Combining everything together, we get to something like below (Ignore the extra code that I have for the rest of my class), and we have our very own super class &lt;code>Object&lt;/code> in C++.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">namespace&lt;/span> lox {

Not just that, I like to version them too so I can go back in time to any point. &lt;code>git&lt;/code> serves as a good tool for me for versioning wherever small data/text files etc are concerned and then I back this up with remote git servers like my own git server on a raspberry pi at home, a gitlab server and a github server. Prime targets for this are my dotfiles that I edit in spacemacs and my notes that I take in &lt;a href="https://joplinapp.org/">Joplin&lt;/a>. The only issue though is that every time I change something, which is pretty often (since I&amp;rsquo;m a tinkering nerd too) I&amp;rsquo;ve to manually commit the changes and push them upstream. Apart from being all kinds of nerds, I&amp;rsquo;m an automation nerd too, which is a fancy way of saying that I am lazy, but I digress.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, essentially I wanted to commit and push changes to my notes, dotfiles and few other things automatically whenever I make changes. I came across a tool called &lt;a href="https://github.com/gitwatch/gitwatch">gitwatch&lt;/a>, which can help do this. But I wanted to try out some more capabilities of &lt;a href="https://www.hammerspoon.org/">Hammerspoon&lt;/a>, so I chose that as my weapon of choice for this, especially because I already use it for few other automations so that&amp;rsquo;s one (or more) less things to install/maintain/update. Hammerspoon is an extremely powerful tool for macOS. In its own words:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>At its core, Hammerspoon is just a bridge between the operating system and a Lua scripting engine. What gives Hammerspoon its power is a set of extensions that expose specific pieces of system functionality, to the user.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So, the things I had to do:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Setup the directories of my dotfiles (&lt;code>~/dotfiles/&lt;/code>) and notes (&lt;code>~/.config/Joplin-desktop/&lt;/code>) as git repositories (by running git init inside them)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create repositories on GitHub (and other servers as needed) to backup them to. You can create them as private if you want to. In my case, my dotfiles are public but my notes are private.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add the upstream repositories to your local git repositories as remotes (&lt;code>git remote add &amp;lt;somename&amp;gt; &amp;lt;remote_url&amp;gt;&lt;/code>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add my ssh keys to the ssh-agent using the &lt;code>ssh-add&lt;/code> command. You can read more about this &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent">here&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Save the below lua script to &lt;code>~/.hammerspoon/git-backup.lua&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Came across &lt;a href="https://bazel.build/">bazel&lt;/a> build system recently at my new job and found it to be quite nice compared to my earlier mainstays CMake and Make. It&amp;rsquo;s fast and correct, just as their website says. But I also liked it because it&amp;rsquo;s explicit with very little magic. And it has a powerful query/tools system that allows you to really analyze your builds and dependencies in depth. Though examples in the wild are a bit less since it is a fairly recent entrant compared to its competitors. For a personal side project, I needed to use SDL2 and it was the first time I had to use an external/pre-built library with bazel. This post documents the process I used for my own future reference and may be help some other lost soul like me. Although, the post talks about SDL2 here specifically, the same process can be used for most other external pre-compiled modules.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="download--install-libsdl">Download / Install libsdl&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Download the latest MacOS dmg file from &lt;a href="http://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php">LibSDL&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Double click the downloaded dmg file&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Copy the &lt;code>SDL2.framework&lt;/code> folder over to &lt;code>/Library/Frameworks&lt;/code> path&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="make-bazel-aware-of-existence-of-sdl2">Make bazel aware of existence of SDL2&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Update your &lt;code>WORKSPACE&lt;/code> file (resides at the root of your project) with below content. This is important because bazel does all the build steps in a sandbox and one cannot depend on anything outside this sandbox. This step allows bazel to make the content present at this path available to the sandbox as a bazel repository.&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The important portions here are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>copts&lt;/code>: To let bazel know where to search for SDL2 header files. Note that the path here is relative to project root.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>linkopts&lt;/code>: Need the &lt;code>-F&lt;/code> option to let compiler know where to search for the framework files and &lt;code>-framework&lt;/code> option as usual to link to ZSDL2. The path with &lt;code>-F&lt;/code> can be absolute one. Not sure why this is not restricted by the sandbox. Investigating this currently.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>deps&lt;/code>: Finally, create the explicit dependency on your sdl2 module by referring to it as &lt;code>@sdl2&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>By now, the project is ready to be compiled and linked.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Create a bit.ly like shorturl static website</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2017/09/17/create-bitly-clone-shorturl-static-website/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Sep 2017 23:46:24 +0530</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2017/09/17/create-bitly-clone-shorturl-static-website/</guid><description>I decided to create my own shorturl website last week for personal use and ended up developing a python project (deecubes)that can be used by anyone to do the same.

This is a post to explain what/why/how about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-my-own-shorturl-website">Why my own shorturl website?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>So far I had been using sites like bit.ly or TinyURL whenever I needed to generate a shorturl (e.g. for giving to someone for easily remember, noting down on paper, putting links on resume, etc) but I had concerns that:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The site could go out of operation anytime.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They seem a bit unprofessional and also, there are a lot of scammy links floating around on these sites that many folks are wary of clicking on them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I lose the SEO juice to external sites&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Custom shorturl keywords were mostly taken&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Keep history of all links I convert&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I could satisfy a few of these points by creating an account and using my custom domain with bit.ly or something but my developer itch sealed the deal by giving me something to code :P.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="requirements-for-the-shorturl-website">Requirements for the shorturl website&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>These were the requirements that I listed out while beginning the project:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Should be cheap af. (I ended up at FREE! ;) )&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Should be maintenance free and run itself (I didn&amp;rsquo;t want another headache to tune/apply patches for and what not)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Should allow addition of links from anywhere (whether on my PC or not)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Should allow random links as well as custom ones&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Should allow to remove previously generated shorturls&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Should allow me to easily see all generated shorturls, preferably along with history&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Allow previewing the link a shorturl points to without redirecting, if needed&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These lead me to decide on a couple of important things:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The site had to be static (Host on s3 for cheap or github pages for free. No patches/maintenance. Super performance)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Had to be version controlled (Easy history/viewing/editing from anywhere.)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="deecubes">deecubes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Thus, &lt;a href="https://shgl.in/deecubes/">deecubes&lt;/a> was born. (The link in the previous line is shortened using deecubes itself, by the way)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The name comes from the short form &amp;lsquo;DSSS&amp;rsquo; of Damn Simple Static url Shortener (so, a D and a cube of S&amp;rsquo;s. Idiotic, I know). You can read more about how to use it at the above link in the README but in summary:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s written in pure python&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It takes a long form url and creates a static website shorturl that can be auto-generated or custom&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s deterministic, so you can be sure of generating the same website from the same inputs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Preview can be seen at &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->/preview.html (e.g. &lt;a href="https://shgl.in/deecubes/preview.html">https://shgl.in/deecubes/preview.html&lt;/a> )&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Published on pypi, so can install with pip&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Several ways to use/deploy (as simple as ftp or bash/batch scripts or manual git commits/push or commit directly through github website etc )&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Take a look at my generated website repository as an example at &lt;a href="https://shgl.in/deecubesdemo">deecubesdemo&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="my-deployment-strategy">My deployment strategy&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I ended up with the following stack to add links rather painlessly from anywhere and not do any maintenance:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Github for hosting the website using github pages&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cloudflare to provide that shiny https and some statistics/caching etc&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Travis to automatically build and deploy the site so I dont need to always generate the shorturl and can commit from anywhere&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Check the repository I linked above to see how it is done. Most of the magic is done in a few lines of the &lt;a href="https://shgl.in/11PAfL1QG/">.travis.yml&lt;/a> file. Essentially it follows this path:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I commit a shorturl .txt file directly in the &amp;ldquo;raw&amp;rdquo; directory through github web on &amp;ldquo;source&amp;rdquo; branch&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Travis picks up the commit and runs deecubes&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;sync&amp;rdquo; command to generate the website portions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Travis deploys the &amp;ldquo;output&amp;rdquo; folder contents to the &amp;ldquo;master&amp;rdquo; branch of the same repo.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Github is configured to serve the website from &amp;ldquo;docs&amp;rdquo; folder of master branch through my custom domain shgl.in (&amp;ldquo;docs&amp;rdquo; folder is already created and checked-in inside output folder along with CNAME file)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cloudflare is configured to redirect all requests to shgl.in to my github repo&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In a more traditional way, I could also do this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Generate a shorturl locally using an &amp;ldquo;add&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;generate&amp;rdquo; command. You could be done at this point and publish the output folder to your website any way you want.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I Commit the generated files including the output into the repo and push to github.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Travis will still run and publish the website as earlier.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="things-to-come">Things to come?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I want to add the following things in next few weeks to the project:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A collision handling mechanism which is also deterministic&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Allow google analytics addition for collecting metrics&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Allow custom templates for redirect and preview urls&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your suggestions?&lt;/li>

I was able to save the graphs to an image file just fine, but if I tried to show them directly on screen while running the script, it just printed a number and exited. After tearing apart my hair for some time, I checked the backend being used by matplot lib:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>import matplotlib matplotlib.get_backend() &lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And there was the problem. It showed the backend being used was &amp;ldquo;agg&amp;rdquo;. Looking at the matplotlib documentation, I figured that this backend is used for rendering the graph into an image and saving it. That explained why I was able to save the images fine. But it didn&amp;rsquo;t have any interactive support. For that I had to install one of the other backends which had this support, e.g., Tkagg. So, for that what I had to do was, first install the Tk related packages using the below command:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>sudo apt-get install tcl-dev tk-dev python-tk python3-tk &lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another important step now is to reinstall matplotlib so that it detects the new backend, but also remember that if you just do a plain pip uninstall/install, it may not work because that will pick up the previous cached installation. So you have to use the &amp;ndash;no-cache-dir option like below:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>pip uninstall matplotlib pip install matplotlib --no-cache-dir &lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, the graphs work fine for both saving as image as well as showing up during runtime.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>NTP Driver For ESP8266</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2015/03/01/ntp-driver-for-esp8266/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2015 08:02:22 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2015/03/01/ntp-driver-for-esp8266/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m building a smartwatch project based around the new IoT posterkid on the block, ESP8266.

With a sigh of relief I subscribed immediately and it was stellar at home with its wonderful 32 million song collection and chromecast support to boot. The experience during the commute daily was underwhelming. Couple the spotty airtel data connection with no one station covering all songs I would love and it makes for a frustrating commute with long gaps all over. Slacker has a radio station caching feature but unfortunately doesn&amp;rsquo;t support India. So I took things into my own hands and Shoutcast2Dropbox was born this weekend. Details follow below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Link: &lt;a href="https://github.com/shantanugoel/Shoutcast2Dropbox">https://github.com/shantanugoel/Shoutcast2Dropbox&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="shoutcast2dropbox---automatic-shoutcast-stations-to-dropbox-recorder">&lt;strong>Shoutcast2Dropbox - Automatic Shoutcast Stations To Dropbox Recorder&lt;/strong>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This simple script allows to automatically download a specified duration of song collections from different shoutcast stations and then automatically upload them to your dropbox. This can be used to create your own station caching feature with a variety of benefits:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Individual songs instead of one lengthy stream so you can skip forward/backwards among them&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mix up a variety of different stations instead of listening to a single type (e.g. I mix up different types of rock and metal stations with a few latest hits ones thrown in)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No buffering/precious mobile data usage as the Dropbox folder can be synced to phone on wifi (I use Dropsync to schedule syncs on home wifi)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>New playlist every day instead of listening to same old stored songs&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I created this for myself one day as I was sick of the many issues that plague streaming music (the ones listed above that are overcome with this script). It may have bugs or may not cover all usecases. I&amp;rsquo;d love to get feedback to fix the bugs and add more features, so feel free to send in your requests.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="dependencies">&lt;strong>Dependencies&lt;/strong>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>For the script:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Linux Host - (PC/Router/Raspberry Pi/Server etc). Script is written for shell currently but may be adapted for windows. I run it on my router as a cronjob.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>streamripper - Opensource Shoutcast recorder program&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dropbox Uploader - For Dropbox sync. Linked as submodule in this git repository.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h1 id="usage">&lt;strong>Usage&lt;/strong>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Once above dependencies are satisfied, run the Dropbox Uploader script and do the steps as mentioned to create a folder for syncing the songs to your Dropbox.
After that, you can run the Shoutcast2Dropbox script as below:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>./Shoutcast2Dropbox.sh &amp;lt;Input File for station lists&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Cumulative Duration to record in seconds&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Output Directory path&amp;gt; &lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Input file should have 1 station url per line. An example file (stations-example.txt) is given in this repository
Duration in seconds is split up into equal durations for each station. e.g. 3600 seconds (1 hour) given here with a station list of 3 means each station will be recorded for 1200 seconds (or 20 minutes).
Output directory is where the songs will be captured to.
Example:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>./Shoutcast2Dropbox.sh stations-example.txt 3600 /home/Shantanu/songs &lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sync the folder to your phone (See tips section ;) )&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="tips">&lt;strong>Tips&lt;/strong>&lt;/h1>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Station urls are not the website urls. You need to get their actual shoutcast stream urls. If they are not present on the website in plain view, generally you can &amp;ldquo;inspect&amp;rdquo; the web page or view source to find those out.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Use aac streams if possible. They are lower size and higher quality compared to mp3s&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Instead of running the script manually, set it up as a cron job to run automatically. I set it up to run every day around noon (so that songs get downloaded by the time I reach home)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Set it up on a low power device which is always on. e.g. I set it up on my router.
i) I had to install a few extras on my router for this to work (e.g. coreutils-stat pkg from entware). You may need to do so as well
ii) I used -k option in script for Dropbox Uploader due to missing ca certificates. You may either choose to install certificates (not a problem on PC but slightly involved on router) or use -k option wherever dropbox uploader commands are used. Didn&amp;rsquo;t check in the k option to avoid security issues by default.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>For listening to fresh playlists every day while on the road with least effort, setup your phone to automatically sync this. I use &amp;ldquo;DropSync&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Tasker&amp;rdquo; for this. DropSync allows to sync any dropbox folder to the phone and tasker automates this process while taking care of not disturbing your normal phone use. I set it up like this:
a. Setup DropSync to do only manual sync.
b. In Tasker, create a profile with this conditions:
i) An hourly repeating time event from 10 PM to 6 AM
ii) Wifi is connected instead of mobile data
iii) Location context is home (from another of my profiles. You can instead choose to use your specific home wifi ssid in above step)
iv) Phone is getting charged (so that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t lose power in the middle)
c. Profile enter task is setup to check a variable if sync is done or not. If not done, then trigger the sync and then set the sync done variable.
d. Profile exit task is setup to clear the sync done variable for next day.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol></content></item><item><title>Browser controlled Raspberry Pi Camera Car</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2014/08/03/browser-controlled-raspberry-pi-camera-car/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Aug 2014 15:33:12 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2014/08/03/browser-controlled-raspberry-pi-camera-car/</guid><description>Spent this weekend building a remote controlled car with a live camera feed with a Raspberry Pi doing the communication and brains duty.

&lt;li>Dagu Mini Driver (Arduino clone + Motor driver)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Raspberry Pi (Model B but any could be used)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A netgear ethernet to wifi adapter (Since I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the raspi cam so had to save a USB port and use this instead of USB wifi adapter)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A cheap old USB webcam&lt;/li>
&lt;li>6 AA Cells&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A sony portable charger to power the raspberry pi and wifi adapter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wires/Screws/Spacers/Tools (lots of them)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Features:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Control the car from any browser&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Can control motion as well as camera pan/tilt from browser using virtual joysticks (Requires multitouch to do pan/tilt as second joystick is needed for this)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Streams back video from car camera to the browser&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Can rotate left/right while being completely stationary&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Can have multiple connections to the car (not recommended for controlling)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Uses websockets for control and response is almost instantaneous like regular toy cars.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Responsive touch-anywhere joysticks using virtualjoystick (&lt;a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/virtualjoystick.js">https://github.com/jeromeetienne/virtualjoystick.js&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>

&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Compile and start mjpg-streamer using mjpg-streamer.sh (Compilation not needed if using my repo as I included a compiled version of mjpg-streamer and needed plugins)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Start websockets and Dagu communication driver back end: controller.py (python controller.py)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Open browser to &lt;code>http://rpi:8090&lt;/code> (or &lt;code>http://&amp;lt;RaspberryPiIPAddress&amp;gt;:8090&lt;/code>) from any device&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Touch anywhere to start controlling the car. Left half of screen corresponds to car movement joystick. Right half of screen corresponds to camera pan/tilt joystick. You can use either one of them or both simultaneously.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Some Important Points:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Found that you can&amp;rsquo;t use standard Servo library along with DC motors as it disables the PWM on pins 9 &amp;amp; 10 as it uses Timer 1 (Should have read the manual in the first place :| )&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Used ServoTimer2 library to avoid this (since it uses timer 2) but it didn&amp;rsquo;t compile. Got it compiling and is added to my github repo as well so you can use it too.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>ServoTimer2 disables use of digital pin 3 for servo. So had to use pin 4 for tilt&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Raspberry Pi has a back power connection somehow through its full USB port :o Avoid this as much as possible and power on the Pi first and then the battery pack on the Dagu mini driver&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The Sony portable charger is pretty nice and the power on/off button actually came in handy though I generally detested it otherwise. This helped in turning off the Pi (CP-F10 L is the model name if you want)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>There is a nice voltage monitor on the Dagu on analog pin 7. This helps in keeping track of the battery levels and can be used to shutdown the car when needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Servos get driven by the USB power as well but motors require battery power for sure&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

Xposed is this awesome framework developed by rovo89 which allows you to carry out mods to your device without changing any files (well except one &amp;ldquo;app_process&amp;rdquo; as part of the xposed installer). Moreover, once you install xposed, you don&amp;rsquo;t need root after that for any mods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This mod will bypass the Email app from becoming device admin for your phone and prevent it from setting up any security restrictions on your device including pin/password/remote wipe, etc. There are a couple other such mods but they don&amp;rsquo;t work at all or don&amp;rsquo;t work for Nexus 4 and/or Android 4.3&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instructions for users&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Remove your existing email account from phone and reboot&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Install Xposed installer (from link above)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Install this mod (Download apk from &lt;a href="https://github.com/shantanugoel/ExchangeBypassXposed/blob/master/ExchangeBypassForXposed/ExchangeBypassForXposed.apk">here&lt;/a> )&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enable the mod in xposed (Preferences for other devices/versions coming Soon)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reboot&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add your email account again. This time, it will ask you that the email
might require security restrictions, say yes to it but it will never actually set the restrictions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Done. :)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Instructions for developers&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Read the xda link at the top of this readme and go through basics of xposed development&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Install xposed as an android sdk addon on your system&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Clone this git repo&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Import in Android Studio&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make changes&lt;/li>

Samsung TVs, which are DLNA enabled, also include a hidden service called &amp;ldquo;Message Box&amp;rdquo; which can display different information on the TV natively irrespective of which display mode/input mode you are in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had come across this while reverse engineering the DLNA protocol extensions that Samsung had built in their TVs to get subtitles working over DLNA but didn&amp;rsquo;t put much thought into it. Fueled by the new Raspberry Pi I recently acquired (more on this later below), I set out to find out the details of this service and exploit it for my need and a few hours later, samsung-messagebox was born :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can get it from here: &lt;a href="https://github.com/shantanugoel/samsung-messagebox">https://github.com/shantanugoel/samsung-messagebox&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Usage:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> usage: samsung-msgbox.py -i IP -m MSG [-p PORT] [-t TIME] [-r RECEIVER]

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Send an arbitrary text message to Samsung TVs which is displayed onscreen.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Developed by Shantanu Goel (http://tech.shantanugoel.com/) version 1.0
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Arguments:
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> -i IP, --ip IP Required. IP Address of the TV
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> -m MSG, --msg MSG Required. Message body text to be sent to TV
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> -p PORT, --port PORT Optional. Port on which message should be sent
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> -t TIME, --time TIME Optional. Receive date and time in epoch/unix format
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> -r RECEIVER, --receiver RECEIVER
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Optional. Receiver Name
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> -x RECEIVER_NO, --receiverno RECEIVER_NO
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Optional. Receiver Number
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> -s SENDER, --sender SENDER
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Optional. Sender Name
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> -y SENDER_NO, --senderno SENDER_NO
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Optional. Sender Number
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> -h, --help
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve tested it currently with my 2010 C Series TV. Hopefully, it should work with any TV that has this service. If you face any problems then let me know and I can try to add support for your TV.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Raspberry PI:&lt;/strong> So, where does raspberry pi figure in all this? Well, I wanted to display my incoming call/text alerts on my TV. So, I made a small webserver in python that I run on my raspberry pi, listening for some special parameters. Whenever I get a call or SMS, I created a tasker profile to call this server with the call/sms parameters and the server in turn calls the above samsung-messagebox.py script to display the alerts. I&amp;rsquo;m also planning to integrate it with a dropbox based service to put it to more uses. Let me know if you have any ideas in mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some pics of this working:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I was asked recently why do I bother now in this age of 24&amp;quot; widescreen monitors (and above) with resolutions of 720p at the bare minimum. I could certainly afford to have more than double that limit staring back at me from the screen without overflowing. Then, am I just being pedantic in following this religiously? Am I not wasting precious screen real estate by doing this?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, NO. The reason I still do it is I can use that real estate for much better purposes while not breaking a sweat (and my neck) while reading long horizontal lines of code. It is still much easier to keep the code size limited horizontally within your immediate focus of vision and you can use the rest of the horizontal space for things like having a directory tree or a database of tags showing. But I keep these extras ready at the whim of a button (mapped to key combos in vim) and the most I use it for is having two (or more) files open simultaneously in vim splits to make the code easier to understand or even write. Many times, what I am reading/writing needs me to back and forth between a few files and I can keep them all open using the big screens if I limit my horizontal code size in each file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wasn&amp;rsquo;t still able to convince the person of my self-imposed rule but maybe I&amp;rsquo;m wrong? What do you follow?&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Adding Lyrics to SharkZapper for Grooveshark</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2011/09/23/adding-lyrics-to-sharkzapper-for-grooveshark/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Sep 2011 09:12:06 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2011/09/23/adding-lyrics-to-sharkzapper-for-grooveshark/</guid><description>I bet all of you know about grooveshark, the awesome music service.

&lt;p>What was even cooler that I learnt a bit about using YQL in the process :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve sent in a pull request to the author of the extension to the original author of the extension to merge this code. In the meanwhile, if you would like to try this out, you can hit up my &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://github.com/shantanugoel/sharkzapper">github repository&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>, download the code and install into chrome by enabling developer mode and choosing &amp;ldquo;Load unpacked extension&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to log the internet bandwidth usage at my home for quite some time since I don&amp;rsquo;t really find the stats put out by my ISP to be completely accurate. But I have multiple devices at home that access the internet so it is not feasible to install a bandwidth monitor individually on all these devices as I&amp;rsquo;d still need to add up all logs and many of such devices don&amp;rsquo;t even have a way to install a monitoring software installed (e.g. my PS3, my TV, my media players, etc). So, I thought of monitoring the usage at my router. It is a smart one (Asus wl-500w) and I can install various linux software on it but then it requires a hard disk to run most of them which I don&amp;rsquo;t turn on all the time. Moreover, even if I could run the software directly from router flash, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have enough space to store the logs (neither is it a good idea to keep writing to the flash often).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hence I came up with the idea of a light weight remote bandwidth usage logger where in the router has to do the bare minimum possible (here, it just has to make a GET call to a webpage with current status of received and transmitted bytes, accomplished by a single line of wget command). The system is completely open source and is intelligent enough to keep track of things even if router reboots or the bytes count wraps around the 4 GB limit (because of 32 bit data structures used). The logging and parsing is all done on server side and provides various useful things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Few of the features of the system:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Very lightweight in CPU/RAM resource usage on host as well as server&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Outputs easy to browse html and graphs&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>User defined directory structure to decide the granularity that is wanted&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>yearly, monthly, daily stats and graphs&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Provides quick access to extra stats like last time the host connected, last known host IP etc&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Provides total download/upload numbers as well as detailed&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Estimates uptime of remote host&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Can use a DNS name or IP to avoid (or call out) spurious amounts of usage logged by a spurious IP&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The code and all files can be found at github: &lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://github.com/shantanugoel/remote-bandwidth-stats">Remote-Bandwidth-Stats&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Now, of course, kinect doesn&amp;rsquo;t work with PS3 obviously but then if we can&amp;rsquo;t break the rules, we can at least bend them a little towards our way. I&amp;rsquo;ve  created a mashup that allows you to use kinect as an input controller for the PS3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Please note that this is pre-alpha quality software currently&lt;/strong>. I haven&amp;rsquo;t updated to a lot of recent code for the below libraries and also haven&amp;rsquo;t done most of the performance/feature improvements yet. The axis performance specially needs lot of tweaking and it works well only while sitting. Putting this out purely as a proof of concept. For the things that I plan to add soon, please see the Todo section below. Follow me at &lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/shantanugoel">@shantanugoel&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> for latest updates.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>
&lt;p>Make sure that the above 4 things are installed on your machine and working fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Default Config&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Menu Profile - This is the default profile that kinect-ps3 starts with and allows to operate the PS3 menus. Moving hand in any direction will move the ps3 menus as if you were using the DPAD with those directions keys pressed. If you run out of the kinect&amp;rsquo;s watched space, then just do a backward push with your hand, bring your hand to center and then again do the backward push and continue scrolling. This is like you lift your finger up and then start dragging from edges of a laptop&amp;rsquo;s touchpad.For selecting any item, make two successive push movements with your hand without changing any x-y direction.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Game Profile - This profile can be switched to by doing 3 successive backward movements of the hand while in Menu profile. Right now I&amp;rsquo;ve implemented only directional controls in game profile because I&amp;rsquo;m still struggling with multiple hands detections and skeletal tracking. A full profile will be activated soon enough. Currently, the your hand&amp;rsquo;s x/y movements and directly translated to right stick x/y movements (e.g. this is looking in different directions in various FPS games). Moving the hand towards or away from kinect (z-axis) translate to left stick y movements (e.g. this is moving fowards or backwards in most FPS games).

&lt;p>Skeletal tracking for better game profiles&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Switching back to menu profiles from game profiles&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Easier way to specify user custom profiles instead of changing code for the same&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Performance improvement for game profiles&lt;/p>

But the problem I faced was that my programs were compiling and running without any errors but I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t see the effect happening, i.e., the events weren&amp;rsquo;t getting injected into the system. I am using Ubuntu Maverick Meerkat (10.10) and when I searched on the net, I saw various other folks are facing the same issue. I finally got it working and here is how.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First problem I came across was that I was using &amp;ldquo;/dev/input/uinput&amp;rdquo; path in my programs but it seems it is changed to &amp;ldquo;/dev/uinput&amp;rdquo; in Ubuntu. Changing this got me past some runtime errors I was getting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I thought that the issue was because uinput module wasn&amp;rsquo;t getting loaded because even after specifically doing a modprobe, I still couldn&amp;rsquo;t see it loaded when I did lsmod. This was strange because the /dev/uinput node was present. On looking under /lib, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even find the uinput.ko file. But then I found that the reason for this is that in Ubuntu Maverick, uinput is not a module anymore. It is built into the kernel now. (See this &lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bluez/+bug/584812">launchpad bug&lt;/a>.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, having figured that the above was a false alarm, I was at a loss how to explain this. But then I tried just changing the permissions of the uinput node to 0666 (i.e. writable by all users) and ran my program without sudo and it worked like a charm. Searching for sudo along with uinput lead me to &lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sudo/+bug/609645">these&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://www.sudo.ws/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=388">bugs&lt;/a> which confirms that the problem is because of this only. So, if you are facing this issue, you can either change the uinput node permissions or install the sudo patch described in the bug discussion page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let me know if this worked for you as well :)&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Android Dev Tip: App Not Showing on X10 Mini Marketplace</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/08/07/android-dev-tip-app-not-showing-on-x10-mini-marketplace/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Aug 2010 21:18:06 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/08/07/android-dev-tip-app-not-showing-on-x10-mini-marketplace/</guid><description>Many Android Developers (and users) get confused that why a certain app isn&amp;rsquo;t showing up on the new Xperia X10 Mini (and few other) phones. This happens even if they support all android versions and have published their apps for all countries, so that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the issue. I came across this as well when few people mentioned that they couldn&amp;rsquo;t find my app Wi-Fi Keep Alive in the X10 mini marketplace.</description><content>&lt;p>Many Android Developers (and users) get confused that why a certain app isn&amp;rsquo;t showing up on the new Xperia X10 Mini (and few other) phones. This happens even if they support all android versions and have published their apps for all countries, so that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the issue. I came across this as well when few people mentioned that they couldn&amp;rsquo;t find my app Wi-Fi Keep Alive in the X10 mini marketplace. On some digging into the android docs and the X10 mini specs, I found the issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem is that the X10 mini has a very small screen with only a QVGA resolution. This screen size/resolution wasn&amp;rsquo;t supported by Android until recently and the Android system might not be able to scale resources and layouts designed for other screen sizes well enough to suit the X10 mini. Hence, the Android system designers have chosen that any app which does not declare explicit support for small screens (i.e., the app dev has tested his app on small screens and made any changes, if needed, and then declared that everything works fine in the Android Manifest) then it is considered not compatible by default and hence, the Android marketplace will filter your app out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, this is a big loss. A lot of X10 minis were sold and there are lot of new low-tier and cheap Android smartphones coming out with this resolution, so it is a significant market share that you can&amp;rsquo;t afford to lose. The solution is simple. If the app does indeed work fine on small screens (or you have fixed it to work), then all you got to do is add the below mentioned line in your AndroidManifest.xml:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>&amp;lt;supports-screens android:smallScreens=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s it. Your app should now show up fine in all screen sizes markets. Note that for all other screen sizes and resolutions, Android considers the default support as true and your app will show in those markets even if you don&amp;rsquo;t make any explicit declarations for them. You can read more about this here: &lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html">Supporting Multiple Screens in Android&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Update: **&lt;a href="http://www.blundell-apps.com/">Blundell&lt;/a> pointed out in the comments that &lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html%23defaults">Android documentation&lt;/a> says&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>This should mean that small screens should be set as supported by default if you have your minSdk &lt;strong>or&lt;/strong> targetSdk  set to anything above or equal to 4. However, in my case, my apps had minSdk as 3 but targetSdk as 7 or 8 but still they didn&amp;rsquo;t show up in X10 mini marketplace till I added the smallScreens support to true in my manifest file. If anyone has any ideas about as to why it was like this, please let me know.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Android App Wi-Fi Keep Alive updated to 1.4.1</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/07/22/android-app-wi-fi-keep-alive-updated-1-4-0/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2010 16:58:07 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/07/22/android-app-wi-fi-keep-alive-updated-1-4-0/</guid><description>Update: Made a minor update for a small bug that can make wi-fi keep reconnecting in quick succession.

&lt;p>Pushed out a new update to my Android App Wi-Fi Keep Alive today. This update brings in another work around for the issue where the wi-fi is alive on the phone and it is also connected to the network but is somehow unable to send/receive any packets to the network. The new work around will automatically re-associate your phone with the wi-fi router if it detects such a situation. This seems to make it work properly again for sometime. When it fails again, the workaround kicks in automatically again. This is not an ideal &amp;ldquo;fix&amp;rdquo; as such because streaming apps like Pandora radio etc might have a hiccup because of this but it is unavoidable as of now and atleast the notifications for mails and other things etc will work fine because this state stops even the mobile data network from taking over since the phone perceives that wi-fi is connected but is not working actually.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other things include support for small screen devices like Xperia X10 mini, some optimizations for size and speed, some icon sizes and UI tweaks for compatibility with different screen sizes and android versions. Please try it out from the market as usual and let me know how it goes.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>BadTokenException Error In Android Dialog</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/07/08/badtokenexception-android-dialog-getapplicationcontext/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jul 2010 11:24:14 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/07/08/badtokenexception-android-dialog-getapplicationcontext/</guid><description>If you are creating a custom Dialog for Android, and following the Android Developers’ Creating Dialogs tutorial, then most likely you would have faced a Force Close with this exception showing up in logcat.

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>It isn’t apparent immediately that what is causing this error. The very first line in the code “Context mContext = getApplicationContext();” is the culprit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Solution:&lt;/strong> Just replace “getApplicationContext()” with “this” (i.e. “Context mContext = this;” ) and it will work fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Explanation:&lt;/strong> As to why this is exactly an issue, I’m a bit fuzzy about it myself but this much I’m sure that the contexts that you get with getApplicationContext and this are different. On reading about this function from Android SDK help:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Return the context of the single, global Application object of the current process. This generally should only be used if you need a Context whose lifecycle is separate from the current context, that is tied to the lifetime of the process rather than the current component.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I think this would mean is that getApplicationContext returns a context which is for the application itself and not the activity, while “this” would give you the context of the activity in which you are creating the dialog. I think since it is the activity which is associated with the UI (and for whom the window has been created), using the application context would have caused the crash here.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>How To Debug Android Widgets</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/06/13/how-to-debug-android-widgets/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jun 2010 18:42:42 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/06/13/how-to-debug-android-widgets/</guid><description>For most new android app developers (like me), it is a bit puzzling how to debug the android widgets or how to put a breakpoint in an android widget code.

For normal applications, it is quite simple as when you press &amp;ldquo;debug&amp;rdquo; on the eclipse toolbar, it launches the emulator (or connects to existing emulator/device), syncs your application and launches its main activity and puts the control in your hands if you have put a breakpoint. For widgets, it seems a bit tricky because there is no activity to be launched, so eclipse just syncs your widget&amp;rsquo;s apk and installs it and that&amp;rsquo;s it. So, is it possible or not to debug widget code? and if yes, then is it very difficult? Fortunately, it is possible and very easy to do but just slightly less intuitive and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any information about it at Android developers website and learnt it by just fumbling around for a few minutes so thought of posting here for the benefit of other newbies like me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, all you need to debug your widget code is almost same as what you do for normal applications. Just follow the below steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Press &amp;ldquo;debug&amp;rdquo; on the eclipse menu (or &amp;ldquo;run&amp;rdquo; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to matter)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Once the widget apk is sync&amp;rsquo;ed and installed onto your emulator/device, switch your eclipse workspace to DDMS mode. You can either do this by pressing the &amp;ldquo;DDMS&amp;rdquo; labeled button on your top right corner or if you can&amp;rsquo;t find it, then do it by going to &amp;ldquo;Window-&amp;gt;Open Perspective-&amp;gt;DDMS&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Select the process name of your widget from the list of processes shown. By default, this list appears at top left of DDMS window. (See screenshot below). If you can&amp;rsquo;t see your widget&amp;rsquo;s process name in the list, it is possible that the widget is not added to the home screen yet. So, do so.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Press the green debug button above the process list (See screenshot below)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>And that&amp;rsquo;s it. Now, if you had put a breakpoint in the code, do something that executes that piece of the code.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

We all need to disable the sync settings of a particular account sometimes  but keep all other items still syncing. For example, for most of the day I&amp;rsquo;m at work, in front of my office PC so I don&amp;rsquo;t need to keep my work email syncing which causes unnecessary drain on my battery but I do need to keep other things, like my google calendar, syncing still. Now, the power control widget that comes with android is a bit too coarse for this use as it presents a situation of all or none. So, if you use the power control widget, it either disables syncing entirely for all your apps or enables it for all of them. So, you have to manually go into accounts and sync settings and turn off syncing for the account you want but it takes too many clicks (You first long hold on menu, then press settings, then scroll to account settings, then click on it to open it). So, instead of that, you can just use this app here. Install and add a shortcut to the home screen. Whenever you need, just click on it and it will open the accounts and sync settings screen for you immediately without any fuss.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The app is very light and consumes no resources and exits immediately leaving no background processes behind. Please try it out and let me know if you like it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To install, either search for &amp;ldquo;Quick Sync Settings&amp;rdquo; in the android market or you can just scan the below given QR code from the barcode scanner app on your phone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=qr&amp;amp;chs=200x200&amp;amp;chl=market://search?q=pname:com.shantz.quicksyncsettings" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PS: I&amp;rsquo;m also developing another app which will allow you to directly control the sync on/off for any account (with fine control also available for each item within each account like mail/calendar/contacts separately) through a power control like widget. It is working for me right now but I&amp;rsquo;m fixing it around the edges so that I can publish a relatively force-close-free app for you :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>NOTE: Quick Sync Settings works only on Android 2.1 and above and you would be unable to find it in the android marketplace if your android version is less than that (Android marketplace automatically filters out apps which are not compatible with your version)&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Real Time Data Plotting with GNUPlot</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/12/29/real-time-plot-gnuplot/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Dec 2009 11:15:51 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/12/29/real-time-plot-gnuplot/</guid><description>I wrote this script a few days ago to plot real-time / streaming data with gnuplot.

A colleague suggested me to use “replot” command with gnuplot. I whipped out my perl hat and a few hours later, voila!! my very own real time data plotter was ready. Now, I can stream data from any program to this script or provide the data on STDIN and can see the data being plotted continuously. BTW, it was awesome to see all the shapes that I drew on my target board’s LCD touchscreen to come alive on my PC monitor almost instantaneously.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I call it “rtgnuplotter”. A weird name I know :P, but I just wanted to refer to it as a real time data plotter based on gnuplot.&lt;/p>

I was working on a script yesterday, a part of which depended on continuous monitoring of a text file. I had used our trusty old &amp;ldquo;tail&amp;rdquo; command for this but while testing by manually putting in some data into the file, it was failing but curiously it was working fine when used in actual scenario. Befuddled, I did a simple test. I created a simple text file &amp;ldquo;a.txt&amp;rdquo; with a few lines of data and then ran the following command.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>tail -f a.txt&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It showed the last few lines of the file and kept waiting. So far so good. Then I opened the file in vim editor, wrote a few more lines, saved the file and then waited but nothing in the window that was running the tail command. Thinking that the data might be buffered and not flushed to the disc yet, I ran the sync command but still nothing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I got a hint that when I used the &amp;ldquo;-F&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;&amp;ndash;follow=name&amp;rdquo; option instead of &amp;ldquo;-f&amp;rdquo;, the tail command was able to detect the change just fine, the only problem being that in this mode, it prints the last few lines again, not just the newly added line. The main difference in these new options is that tail command tracks the file for changes by its name and not by the file descriptor, and then it dawned on me. The problem is not in the tail command but my testing method itself. When I save the file opened in vim, it creates a new file with a new inode while the one opened by tail is still the old one (which is now a temporary file which has actually been deleted). When I quit tail, then the kernel deletes the file automatically. This is also confirmed by running &amp;ldquo;lsof | grep a.txt&amp;rdquo; (lsof lists the open files and then we find the ones related to a.txt). The output shown is;&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>tail 11966 shantanu 3r REG 8,6 8 224954 /home/shantanu/dev/perl/plot/a.txt~ (deleted)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>vim 12576 shantanu 9u REG 8,6 12288 210918 /home/shantanu/dev/perl/plot/.a.txt.swp
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>which shows what we had discussed above. This gets worked around when I use the -F option because then tail periodically reopens the file by name and reads it again, thus bypassing the above issue. Then I simply tried running tail again on the same file and doing something like &amp;ldquo;echo abc &amp;raquo; a.txt&amp;rdquo; and I could see the behaviour as expected with tail immediately detecting the change and displaying it in its window. Hope this helps if you have been pulling out your hair thinking you have gone crazy as your favourite little tool that you have been using for so many years has suddenly stopped working and no one else apart from you is even complaining :P&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Compiling Latest FireFly (mt-daapd) for ASUS WL-500W</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/07/03/compiling-latest-firefly-mt-daapd-asus-wl-500w/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2009 10:28:32 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/07/03/compiling-latest-firefly-mt-daapd-asus-wl-500w/</guid><description>FireFly is a nice DAAP based media server that allows you to listen to your music collection anywhere using any DAAP based client like iTunes, with other players (like Winamp, Rhythmbox, VLC, etc) using plugins, or it even has its own dedicated php/flash/java based clients that can be fired up on any platform any computer giving you instant nirvana.

&lt;p>Many people, like me, use it on their Routers or NAS boxes to access their music anywhere without having to keep their home PC running or lugging around external drives. However, development on this gem stopped some time ago. The last stable build released (2.4.2) was good but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of features provided by the nightly builds in svn (subversion). And the last nightly build released (svn-1696) had a lot of broken things. It was rebuilding the database everytime, crashed around quite a bit, had a lot of security holes. So, I decided to get the latest version (trunk) of the FireFly code, as it had a lot of fixes for above issues, put in whatever was missing, and try to build it for my use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a day&amp;rsquo;s worth of efforts, here it is. This latest build is the most rich in features as compared to the stable one, and is just as stable as the 2.4.2 release if not better, and also fixes all the issues shown by the svn-1696 build. The downloadable source and complete install package are attached with this post. But I&amp;rsquo;m also listing down the steps that I took to achieve this so that if anyone wants to recompile it with their own options (e.g. I haven’t included ogg/flac support in my build), they are able to do so. You can find the steps below. Please let me know if you have any queries. Also, if you want to submit any patches, I’ll be happy to incorporate them and recompile. I’m also trying to get this source and package into the unslung/optware repositories for wider distribution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note: Although I’ve compiled this for Asus WL-500W, it should work for most devices with a mipsel architecture (which includes all the Asus routers in this family). Also, the compilation process should work for most other architectures barring one or two steps. I’d be happy to help if you want to do so and face any issues.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Changes and Build Steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>ipkg install optware-devel&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>ipkg install buildroot&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Edit /opt/share/aclocal/audiofile.m4 and change AC_DEFUN(AM_PATH_AUDIOFILE, to AC_DEFUN([AM_PATH_AUDIOFILE],&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>ipkg install gettext (for some missing m4 macros, libr_rpath etc)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Comment out AC_USE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS in configure.in (using dnl)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>aclocal -I &amp;lt;path of mt-daapd&amp;rsquo;s local m4 dir&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>run “autoheader” to generate config.h.in&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>touch config.rpath (somehow this file is not provided with gettext for us)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>change configure.in line 95, remove the ; at the end&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>remove -g flag and add -O2 in configure.in for optimization purpose&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>run “automake &amp;ndash;add-missing”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>run “autoconf” - to generate configure&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>ipkg install grep (for egrep)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>change /bin/sh to /opt/bin/bash in configure and install-sh&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>run “./configure &amp;ndash;enable-sqlite3 &amp;ndash;prefix=/opt CPFLAGS=”-D_LIBC” ” (You can also use &amp;ndash;enable-oggvorbis and/or &amp;ndash;enableflac)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>After this step, I had to make numerous changes to the source code to put in the missing functionality for database handling, removing some compilation errors, etc. You can diff the svn 1715 code with mine to see the changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>run “make”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>run “make install”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>And you are done. The modified source and compiled bianries can be downloaded from below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Lost the files in a server move. Sorry :(&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let me know if you have any queries or face any issues.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Project: Figlet Online - Text To ASCII Converter Tool</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/03/24/figlet-online-text-to-ascii-converter-tool/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Mar 2009 14:00:29 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/03/24/figlet-online-text-to-ascii-converter-tool/</guid><description>Figlet is a brilliant tool to convert text to amazing ASCII Art that I have used for many years.

Just drag the top level directory onto the changelist area and the GUI takes care of everything but there is no straightforward way to do this through command line, until, I discovered the &amp;ldquo;-x&amp;rdquo; option of P4. So, here it is how to achieve this. Run the following command after cd&amp;rsquo;ing to the directory you want to add:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For Unix/Linux (or if you have the unix utils installed in windows through GNUWin32, UnixUtils or Cygwin):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>find . -type f -print | p4 -x - add&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For Windows:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>dir /b /s /a-d | p4 -x - add&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have your own tips and tricks about perforce to carry out tasks easily that do not seem so simple in the first go through command line, please do let me know.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Project: My WordPress Plugin Shantz WP Prefix Suffix Updated to 1.1.4</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/03/02/wordpress-plugin-shantz-wp-prefix-suffix-updated-114/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Mar 2009 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/03/02/wordpress-plugin-shantz-wp-prefix-suffix-updated-114/</guid><description>Here comes another update, and this time it is a majorly recommended one.

&lt;p>This update brings in WordPress 2.7.1 compatibility and also another option to control the plugin order. If there are some other plugins that add content to your posts (e.g. sociable, simple tags, related posts, etc), you might notice that the text/code you append with this plugin may not occur in exactly the place you want (e.g. you might want to occur after all other plugins have posted their content). So, you can easily control this now by changing the priority value in the plugin settings. Make it higher to push the content down and lower it to add your content before anything else.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Project: Shantz XWinWrap Update to 0.3</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/02/16/project-shantz-xwinwrap-update-to-03/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2009 18:30:03 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/02/16/project-shantz-xwinwrap-update-to-03/</guid><description>Here is another update for the fans of XWinWrap, the tiny program that allows you to run animated wallpapers on your system.

You could use screensavers, movies and what not as your desktop background. This update fixes a segfault that many users were facing, a new debug option to print some debug mesages to get some info if it is not working for you and a new hack option for giving a &amp;ldquo;desktop window&amp;rdquo; name to the program. On many systems, the desktop is drawn by another program. e.g. in Ubuntu with Gnome environment, the desktop is managed by Nautilus, which creates a special window called &amp;ldquo;Desktop&amp;rdquo; and places it over your real desktop. This window name can be different in different systems. To find out what is yours, just run &amp;ldquo;xwininfo&amp;rdquo; in a terminal. Your cursor will become a &amp;ldquo;+&amp;rdquo; sign. Click anywhere on an empty area on your desktop, which will give you the window name of the transparent window, if any, that is covering your desktop. Pass this info to xwinwrap using the option &amp;ldquo;-d windowname&amp;rdquo; and it would help it to run better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As usual, 32 bit as well as 64 bit binary files are available as downloads. For users of Debian and derived operating systems (like Ubuntu, Mepis, etc), deb packages are also included for both architectures for easy installation.

This works very fine with ad plugins like adsense-manager etc, as you don&amp;rsquo;t have to manipulate your posts or templates to add the ad code, shantz-wp-prefix-suffix will do that for you automatically for all posts and with the adsense plugin you can control whether to &amp;ldquo;display&amp;rdquo; the ad or not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Changes in this version include options to enable/disable displaying the text/code on home page and excerpts.

&lt;p>After a bit of debugging I saw that when I received the ReceivedImMessage signal for the first message, the &amp;ldquo;Conversation ID&amp;rdquo; field is not a valid value but 0. Thereafter, I got the correct value every time. Searching on the google didn&amp;rsquo;t reveal much except a few other people complaining about the same and someone saying that this is a bug because pidgin first sends the signal and then creates the conversation while it should be the other way round.  Fair enough. But then&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I came across a short explanation by a pidgin developer, seanegen, (sorry lost the link somewhere). Basically, the reason behind this is that all the checks (e.g. Blacklists etc) are performed after one gets this signal, and hence they dont create the window otherwise it might be created even if you have blocked the person who is sending you the message. Perfect explanation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, what&amp;rsquo;s the solution. Simple..Use the &amp;ldquo;DisplayedImMessage&amp;rdquo; (or &amp;ldquo;displayed-im-message&amp;rdquo; signal) which is sent, once the conversation has been created. That&amp;rsquo;s it. Hope that this post benefit you.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Shantz XWinWrap: The "Moving" Wallpaper Fun Continues</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/09/03/shantz-xwinwrap-the-moving-wallpaper-fun-continues/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2008 14:46:02 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/09/03/shantz-xwinwrap-the-moving-wallpaper-fun-continues/</guid><description>XWinWrap is a small utility written a loooong time ago that allowed you to stick most of the apps to your desktop background (Thanks to fsckin for introducing me to it).

Basically it allows you to divide up your contact list into groups based on email IDs and execute actions based on when someone from a particular group messages you while you are away. e.g. For general friends, you can keep a message like “Will talk to you later when I come back”, or if someone from office IMs you, it’ll send them your phone number “Call me at XXXXXX if urgent”. And if you boss is the one pinging you, you could direct the message towards your twitter account so that you get it as an SMS on your phone immediately.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Project: Shantz Webcam Autolocker</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/08/11/project-shantz-webcam-autolocker/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2008 17:51:31 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/08/11/project-shantz-webcam-autolocker/</guid><description>Sometimes I do some things that even I can&amp;rsquo;t explain why I did &amp;rsquo;em.

The call in question was _OSI(“Linux”).

The call in question was _OSI(“Linux”). He goes on to say that the action the firmware takes, on finding out if the OS is linux, was probably inaccurate and it was good that linux kernel DOES NOT identify itself as “Linux” and returns false for the _OSI(“Linux”) and instead returns true when probed for Windows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That got me thinking, the first thought being that isn’t this a BIG flaw in the kernel. I mean, trying to make the firmware aware of the OS and doing things accordingly is a good thing, right? Vendors can provide workarounds for OS flaws in this way. e.g. the thermal critical temperature event workaround that HP has for Windows Vista. If we are just emulating Vista here, then aren’t we inheriting their bugs as well? But “Never make judgements straightaway”, I have learnt in the past. So, thought about reading it a bit more. After some googling around, I came to know the sound reasoning behind the decision.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Why not return true for _OSI(“Linux”)?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The difference between Linux and Windows is that the linux kernel is a continuously (and rapidly) moving target. When somebody probes for Windows 98 or Windows 2000 or Windows Vista, they can be sure about the behaviour, but Linux is too generic for us. The bug in one version of the kernel can be fixed in another one, and the behaviour changes, so one cannot rely on _OSI(“Linux”) as there is no generic/constant “Linux” interface.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>Why not then support _OSI(“Linux.xx.xx.xx”) or something equivalent to signify the kernel version?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This is also not reliable because which kernel would this be, the mainline, Ubuntu’s kernel, Fedora’s kernel, Suse’s kernel, or some user patched kernel? Moreover, the bugs fixed in later kernel versions are often backported to earlier versions by various distros. So, again one cannot rely on the kernel version as such, and there are just too many different kernel branches out there for a vendor to check against.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>Why to return true for something like _OS(“Windows 2006”)?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>What I found out is that they do it because most vendors do most checks only if they find Windows and hence, it becomes a necessity to return true for this, for now.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>But what does that mean, is it always going to remain the same?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Basically, what the kernel guys want is a better usage of the _OSI strings. They want the BIOS developers to check for a “capability” rather than a platform or platform version. Because consistent behaviour might be expected when checked for a platform like Windows (Actually its a platform + its version because there are separate strings for Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows NT, Windows Vista, etc) because they are slow moving targets with major changes to ACPI behaviour done only with the next version of the OS that is released after many years, but this is not true for faster targets like linux where changes happen often and can even be backported. So, essentially the situation will remain the same until vendors straighten out their code.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="5">
&lt;li>But is it justified for the linux developers/users to expect this to be followed by the vendors?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This is a tough question with no straight answer. Even though linux users are in minority but still they are significant in number, and if they pay the same money for the hardware as their windows counterparts, they should get the same level of firmware support as well. However, that said, it is also true that the vendors have to draw the line somewhere and given the rapidly changing behaviour of the kernel they cannot always be expected to keep up, especially with all the costs involved. Thats why the kernel community wants them to be aware of these inherent flaws in their design and move to a system (check for capability, not for platform) where they don’t have to “keep up” anymore. And meanwhile they absorb the strain into the kernel/drivers, emulating as Windows, and trying to make the workarounds for Windows bugs in their code instead. And they have started efforts to make the vendors aware of this linux peculiarity and are trying to document the linux behaviour&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I’m convinced with the reasoning. But as always, one man cannot look at all the angles and I might have missed the one that makes this all junk. Are you convinced too? Or do you have any other angle to provide?&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>My Brief History With Computers</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/06/23/my-brief-history-with-computers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2008 14:30:00 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/06/23/my-brief-history-with-computers/</guid><description>I’m going to be bespectacled and have been advised to reduce and limit my computer usage considerably.

GLib is a utility library for C, which augments the standard C library in several purposeful ways to make your life that much easier while programming. GLib has the following things to offer you:
**1. Portability: **The main issue that haunts any C developer is the portability of code.

&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://library.gnome.org/devel/glib/">GLib&lt;/a> is a utility library for C, which augments the standard C library in several purposeful ways to make your life that much easier while programming. GLib has the following things to offer you:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**1. Portability: **The main issue that haunts any C developer is the portability of code. One cannot rely on the standard C library for this as you may find many functions that work differently under different platforms are aren&amp;rsquo;t there at all sometimes. GLib ensures that the all the functionality exposed by it remains consistent across platforms, so that you can rest assured that your code will work the way its supposed to work irrespective of the Operating System it&amp;rsquo;s being used for (Of course, this assumes that you have ensured about portability aspects of your non-GLib related source code). Moreover, GLib is available for a vast array of contemporary Operating Systems including GNU/Linux, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**2. Security: **Though you still need to be careful about things like freeing allocated memories properly, etc but GLib does ensure that all its functionality is secure. Moreover, GLib has a policy of ensuring that all its functions are threadsafe. This saves you from a lot of checks and balances and locks and scheduling considerations if you had written all this yourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>3. Useful Data Types:&lt;/strong> GLib exposes a lot of data types. Some are very basic that maintain portability across OS&amp;rsquo;s and 32-bit and 64-bit systems. e.g. you can rest assured that gint32 will always be 32 bit and gint64 will always be 64 bit data types.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apart from this, it also provides a lot of derived data types e.g. singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, hash tables, stacks, queues, trees, and much more. It&amp;rsquo;d basically cover most of you data structure needs that you&amp;rsquo;d have otherwise had to implement yourselves. And it also provides helper functions that makes working with them so much more easier. If you have ever used Perl, and have wished that C programming could be a bit faster like it, you will be pleasantly surprised.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**4. Utility Functions: **GLib also provides various utility functions to ease out your manipulation of data. Some of the functions are meant as more secure and portable replacements for those provided with standard C library, while rest are meant to provide other useful functionality which you earlier had to implement in your code. Some of the major areas covered by GLib&amp;rsquo;s utility functions are String manipulation, character set manipulation and conversion (including unicode and base64), using regular expressions, file manipulation, shell functions, config file parsing (my favourite), etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>End Note:&lt;/strong> I can understand that there would be a lot of people who believe that use of GLib is dumbing down programming in C. After all, we take pride being in control of our code and this is why we love progrmming in C because we have options to do things in our own way. Yes, that is all true but there comes a time where you&amp;rsquo;d like to spend more time in developing the core functionality of your app, or focus more on giving a rapid shape to your new idea, rather than reinventing the wheel and fumbling around with writing the helper functions. So, keeping that in mind I believe GLib is wonderful piece of code that has enabled me to churn out new apps that much faster.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Project: shantz-wp-prefix-suffix Updated to 1.0.2</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/07/project-shantz-wp-prefix-suffix-updated-to-102/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2008 03:30:00 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/07/project-shantz-wp-prefix-suffix-updated-to-102/</guid><description>Many users reported errors while activating the version 1.0.1 of my WordPress plugin shantz-wp-prefix-suffix.

But it wasn&amp;rsquo;t that good as it took care of only the situation when this phenomena was caused by the tag cloud widget. So, here is a little modification I did to fix the issue more properly.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Go to your wp-content/themes/&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> folder and open the style.css file in your favourite text editor.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Search for &amp;ldquo;#sidebar&amp;rdquo; (without the quotes) until you reach the following code:&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>#sidebar-right,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>#sidebar-left {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> width: 210px;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> color: #666666;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> line-height: 160%;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>Now, modify this code to look like:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>#sidebar-right,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>#sidebar-left {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> width: 210px;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> color: #666666;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> line-height: 160%;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> word-wrap: break-word;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>That&amp;rsquo;s it. Save your file and you are done.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>So what does it do? Basically I just added an attribute &amp;ldquo;word-wrap: break-word&amp;rdquo; to the sidebar handling. So, if there is a word that cannot fit in the sidebar width, the word will be broken to continue in the next line and thus the sidebar alignment will remain intact. let me know if you face any issues with this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note&lt;/strong> that this particular word-wrap property is Internet Explorer specific. Firefox (and other browsers) will ignore it, but since the problem with sidebar alignment occurs only with IE, so it will enable IE to display your site properly.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>HACK: Fixing The Code Syntax Highlighter WordPress Plugins To Work With WYSIWYG</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/23/hack-fixing-the-code-syntax-highlighter-wordpress-plugins-to-work-with-wysiwyg/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2008 17:18:22 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/23/hack-fixing-the-code-syntax-highlighter-wordpress-plugins-to-work-with-wysiwyg/</guid><description>There are many code syntax highlighter plugins available for WordPress (e.g. iG Syntax Highlighter, WP-Syntax, etc) but almost all of them have a problem.

They want you to write the code in &amp;ldquo;HTML editing mode&amp;rdquo;. If you use any kind of WYSIWYG or visual editors (like built in TinyMCE or offline clients&amp;rsquo; similar modes), there is a grave problem. Your code becomes garbled. e.g.:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you intend to write:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>It might turn out as:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>blockquote&amp;gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> cat abc &amp;gt; /dev/null&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The issue here is that the code highlighting plugins use the &amp;ldquo;exact&amp;rdquo; text entered within the [ code ] (or similar) tags, and since we used the WYSIWYG/visual editors, they add html formatting tags to the code and also convert some special characters into HTML entities (e.g. &amp;gt; into &amp;gt;, &amp;lt; into &amp;lt;, white space into  , etc).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The workaround is that you can write the code in html editing mode. But the problem here is that if you happen to switch to the visual mode or edit your post in this mode any time later, the problem will come back which makes editing posts a pain. So, here is a simple hack that will let you write your code in visual/WYSIWYG mode without doing anything special.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Note: **Although this hack is for &lt;a href="http://blog.igeek.info/still-fresh/2006/02/25/code-for-fun/">iG:Synatx Highlighter&lt;/a> plugin, but it can be added similarly to other plugins as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step 1) Open the file syntax_hilite.php.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step 2) Go to line no. 191 and delete the following 3 lines:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Step 3) At the same place (from where you deleted the lines), add the following lines:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Step 4) Save the file. That&amp;rsquo;s it. You&amp;rsquo;re done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What we just did was strip out all the extraneous html formatting added by your editor and then convert the html entities into the characters that we want.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**IMPORTANT: **After this hack, you should write your code in visual mode. If you want to display some html code to your readers and write it in html mode of the editor then it might go boink. Otherwise it should be simple enough to create a new tag so that one set html editor code works and for another set, visual editor code works. But I would definitely recommend against it and anyways writing all code in visual mode, just like your other parts of your posts as its much more intuitive to write and easier to maintain and port to newer platforms.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Project: Windows Mobile Tool ShantzTodayChanger Updated to version 1.53</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/22/project-windows-mobile-tool-shantztodaychanger-updated-to-version-153/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2008 20:49:17 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/22/project-windows-mobile-tool-shantztodaychanger-updated-to-version-153/</guid><description>ShantzTodayChanger is a little tool written by me for your Windows Mobile based phones (WM5/WM6) which will cycle ur today background or theme after a set interval of time.

This is what it is, a dirtly little hack, otherwise I&amp;rsquo;d have called it an &amp;ldquo;enhancement&amp;rdquo; Now onto the main things.
**Aim: **You would have used wp_list_pages (or plugins like dd-list-subpages, that use it) to display a list of your pages/subpages on a particular page. e.g., I use it on my &amp;ldquo;Projects&amp;rdquo; pages hierarchy to list all the relevant projects under a particular heading.</description><content>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Disclaimer:&lt;/strong> I&amp;rsquo;m neither a WordPress guru nor a PHP expert. This is what it is, a dirtly little hack, otherwise I&amp;rsquo;d have called it an &amp;ldquo;enhancement&amp;rdquo; &lt;img src="http://tech.shantanugoel.com/uploads/smile1.gif" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now onto the main things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Aim: **You would have used wp_list_pages (or plugins like &lt;a href="http://www.dagondesign.com/articles/list-subpages-plugin-for-wordpress/">dd-list-subpages&lt;/a>, that use it) to display a list of your pages/subpages on a particular page. e.g., I use it on my &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://tech.shantanugoel.com/projects">Projects&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; pages hierarchy to list all the relevant projects under a particular heading. Now, the thing is that wp_list_pages gives you a lot of options to display things like dates, page title, page link, etc, but that&amp;rsquo;s not enough. I need to provide a small description for each page as well, to put things into perspective. Obviously, I don&amp;rsquo;t expect the visitors to go inside each link to see what it holds in store for them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Hack:&lt;/strong> What you need to do is locate a file called &amp;ldquo;classes.php&amp;rdquo; in your wordpress installation. It is usually located at &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->/wp-includes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, open the file and find a function called &amp;ldquo;start_el&amp;rdquo;. This is a function in the &amp;ldquo;Walker&amp;rdquo; class, which is used in WordPress to parse tree-like structures. Here, it used by wp_list_pages to list out all the pages. Now, at the very end of this function (just after the closing brace of if ( !empty($show_date) ) { ), place the following piece of code:&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What this code does is:&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Look for a custom field called &amp;ldquo;description&amp;rdquo; in your pages. If present, it will show what you wrote there after each of your page in the list generated by wp_list_pages. (To add a custom field to your page, look at the very bottom of your &amp;ldquo;write&amp;rdquo; page or &amp;ldquo;manage&amp;rdquo; page in the WordPress dashboard.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>If the &amp;ldquo;description&amp;rdquo; field is not present (obviously you might not like to go back and add a custom field to all your pages), it takes the first 250 characters of your page&amp;rsquo;s content and displays that.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Hack Is Not Finished Yet:&lt;/strong> There is just one little thing left to do. As I mentioned, this function is used other times as well (e.g. making your navigation menu). So, you don&amp;rsquo;t want the description to be appearing always, otherwise it will wreak havoc on your site&amp;rsquo;s layout. So, there is again a dirty little trick to prevent this.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>At the place where you are calling wp_list_pages, modify the call to include the following code before and after the call:&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>And, modify the previously listed code as well to look like:&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What this does now is that it adds an option/variable to WordPress database, which you set to 1 before calling wp_list_pages to tell your code that now its time to display the description, and then restore its state to 0, to prevent the description from being displayed for any other wp_list_pages call.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>For your reference, I&amp;rsquo;m attaching my copy of classes.php here.&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://tech.shantanugoel.com/uploads/classes.php.zip">File Attachment: classes.php.zip (6 KB)&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For an example of how it finally looks like, take a look at my &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://tech.shantanugoel.com/projects">Project&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; page.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Now It Is Finished:&lt;/strong> Yes, am not lying. It&amp;rsquo;s done. All your &amp;ldquo;Thank You&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; are accepted, and so are your flames, if any &lt;img src="http://tech.shantanugoel.com/uploads/smile1.gif" alt="">.&lt;/p>

Now, you can copy/move those files to different destinations based on their IDs. What&amp;rsquo;s even better is that your basket will remain intact even across reboots. So, you can continue working on the files in the basket even for days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Note: **Packages for windows as well as linux have been uploaded. If you have perl, a perl script is also given that works in both platforms without change. I have tested it on Windows XP SP2 and Ubuntu Feisty Fawn 7.04.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Project: shantz-wp-qotd and shantz-wp-prefix-suffix updated</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/15/project-shantz-wp-qotd-and-shantz-wp-prefix-suffix-updated/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2008 17:26:52 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/15/project-shantz-wp-qotd-and-shantz-wp-prefix-suffix-updated/</guid><description>Just some news on my WordPress plugins front. shantz-wp-qotd has been updated to version 1.2.1 and shantz-wp-prefix-suffix has been updated to 1.0.1.

I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that he will be enriching this site from time-to-time as a guest editor/author. First up is a small tid-bit of a script that he wrote to ease up his life between installations and reinstallations of everyone&amp;rsquo;s favourite OS: Ubuntu. Over to his post..&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Have you ever had to reinstall your ubuntu installation, and then bear the pain of manually installing the applications you&amp;rsquo;ve come to love (i mean use :)) everyday? If yes, then cheer up buddy, because all you really need is some magic (read scripting), some typing and spend some time digging the package names of your favourite applications.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To get started, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to type the package information in a configuration file. The format of the file is really simple&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Any line starting with a # is ignored&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Blank lines are ignored&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Any other line, the first word is taken as the package name you want to install&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In case you do not specify the configFile (e.g. package-names.lst), it will bug you to manually enter packages names :D.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What this script does is&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>read package names from the file specified (or bug user for package names in case filename is not specified)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>install these packages&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s it. And if everything runs fine, you should have a system will all your beloved apps installed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The below snippet from the sample configuration file would install the packages – hardinfo, gmountiso, devilspie and nautilus-open-terminal. The lines for sysinfo and istanbul would be ignored. In case you later wish to install these packages, all you need to do is uncomment the line, and run the script again :).&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Note:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The script will fail in case the package cannot be found using the repositories enabled on your system.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>In case you use additional repositories, you must add these manually to your apt configuration file, and do&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>The hard part is not the installation, but setting up the applications to your likings :D&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote></content></item><item><title>Project: shantz-wp-qotd Updated and shantz-wp-prefix-suffix released</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/24/project-shantz-wp-qotd-updated-and-shantz-wp-prefix-suffix-released/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Feb 2008 09:44:24 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/24/project-shantz-wp-qotd-updated-and-shantz-wp-prefix-suffix-released/</guid><description>I updated my wordpress plugin shantz-wp-qotd.

Armed with my laptop and multiple flasks of coffee, the marathon began on Friday night. My only experience with web-related development so far had been around 8–10 years ago as a kid when, just like everybody else at that time, I was fascinated by HTML and did a “read-through” of HTML 4.0. But I have always been a believer of the theory that a C programmer can program in any language quickly without having to go through the whole manuals. Thus that night bore fruit for me, and by 5:30 in the morning I had a working “Quote of The Day” plugin at my hand with all the features I wanted it to have in its first avatar. Did a bit of polishing last night, fixed a few bugs, and created a readme, and here it is, Mr. shantz-wp-qotd “1.0”, in all its glory, ready for general consumption.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Features at a glance:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Add quotes to all your posts automatically.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Widget support - Can also have a widget in the sidebar for quotes.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Customize and style your quotes with your own text and tags.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Multiple sources for quotes (paste in admin page, get from file implemented, fetch from web/rss soon to come)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Multiple patterns for quotes - Random Quote, Quote of the day (all posts display quote of the day), Quote of that day (all posts display quote for their own days)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Pattern for widget can be different&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Customization for widget can be different&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Add quotes to top or bottom of posts&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Enable/Disable the quotes without deactivating the plugin&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Coming Soon:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Fetch from web/RSS support&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Custom template tag to add quote anywhere you want&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Custom quote boundary decalarator tags/Multiline quote support (Right now, each quote has to be on a new line)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Quotes Categories&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Pics support for quotes&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Anything else you want&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>File selection&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>And more…&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Site Updates: More Content For You</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/03/site-updates-more-content-for-you/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Feb 2008 19:36:42 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/03/site-updates-more-content-for-you/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve added a few new sections to the blog.
