&lt;p>In the sweet monsoons, some 25 years ago, a lot of Indian kids started dreaming of this when the show Shaka Laka Boom Boom went on air. It had a magical pencil that the show&amp;rsquo;s protagonist Sanju could use to draw anything, and it became a reality. Now, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really watch the show because I was already in my 20s by then and it felt too childish to me at the time. But the kids around me could not stop singing praises about it and how they wanted to be the lucky Sanju.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>Imagine that you wake up one day and discover that you have the power to bring your ideas to life!

&lt;p>In the sweet monsoons, some 25 years ago, a lot of Indian kids started dreaming of this when the show Shaka Laka Boom Boom went on air. It had a magical pencil that the show&amp;rsquo;s protagonist Sanju could use to draw anything, and it became a reality. Now, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really watch the show because I was already in my 20s by then and it felt too childish to me at the time. But the kids around me could not stop singing praises about it and how they wanted to be the lucky Sanju.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I wasn&amp;rsquo;t alien to this longing, or feeling. I first had this feeling when I learned to code, another 15 years or so before this. Every Wednesday, I religiously took off my shoes outside the school&amp;rsquo;s computer lab, lest a smitten of dust bork the machines inside, cranked that key to unlock the CPU, inserted an 8-inch floppy diskette inside it to boot it to start coding those silly programs in BASIC.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/cpu-lock.jpg" alt="Alohamora">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was overjoyed when one day I learned I could draw circles on the screen through my programs. A decade later as I typed HTML in Notepad and saw all kinds of things happen on screen, I felt this is it!! And then as I waded further into programming through college and beyond, it just was as if a vast ocean had been suddenly unlocked for a frog, who had only so far jumped around in a puddle of mud, to swim in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I always thought this was the high point of my &amp;ldquo;creation&amp;rdquo; journey. That nothing could surpass this power that I held beneath my grubby little fingers as they danced around in motions not exceeding a couple of inches max and things happened. A lot of people talk about doing things other than programming. That they programmed so much at work and they needed to do something else to relax. For me, programming was (and in many ways, still is) relaxation. How could someone have a superpower and not always be reveling in joy using it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then around 2 years ago, I bought a 3D printer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/creality-ender-3-s1-pro.jpg" alt="">
&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/3d-rabbit.jpg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was my Shaka Laka Boom Boom moment. I could now understand why all those kids all those years ago went gaga over a silly pencil. I mean I could even now print a replica of that pencil at home. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve designed and printed nozzles for my Dyson vacuum, fixed and built toys for my little princess when she demanded them, fixes for my guitar, my bathroom door knobs, water alarms for my RO reject water tank when Bangalore suffers through a water crisis, a cover to save my steam deck when I travel, amazing projects for my teenage son, the iPhone nightstand that Apple showed in its keynote but never released, an Airtag case for the apple tv remote so I could never lose it again, tons of gifts for myself and friends. I&amp;rsquo;m a builder and a tinkerer. When people rush to call for help for any simple thing around the house, I rush towards my tool chest. And here I had a magic wand to now create the parts I needed to fix anything I wanted, whenever I wanted, and even create the tools to fix those parts. I mean I could even print a motha-fuckin&amp;rsquo; GODZILLA!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve printed all these and many many more things (You can see more on my &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/shantanugoel">Twitter&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://instagram.com/shantanugoel_">Instagram&lt;/a>). That combination of programming and 3d printing gives me a feeling of control over the virtual and parallel world, which is nothing short of feeling like the almighty Brahma, the Lord of Creation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If this is not life-changing, then what is?&lt;/p>

It also puts a handy menu in the menubar that allows me to launch the apps or switch between various options. It also shows a number &amp;ldquo;1&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;3&amp;rdquo; adjacent to the menu icon to display what layout I&amp;rsquo;m currently using. Pretty nifty!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I tried several things by updating the kernel, picking up several patches, trying different distros but nothing helped. I also found a few such issues reported on raspi&amp;rsquo;s forums/elsewhere without much updates and with/without the PoE hat. Ultimately, I tried a simple solution of resetting ethernet via &lt;code>ethtool&lt;/code> when the issue happens and it worked fine as a workaround. If you see this issue as well and want to employ this workaround, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy to do via creating the following 3 files (Note: I&amp;rsquo;ve used systemd timers here. You could instead do it through cron as well).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="file-1-monitorsh">File 1: monitor.sh&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This file has the code to check the network state and reset ethernet&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="recon">Recon&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Assuming you&amp;rsquo;ve done the setup as needed for Part 1 of this series, we straight away jump to run the challenge to see what we are after.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>user@protostar:/opt/protostar/bin$ ./stack4
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>ABCD
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>user@protostar:/opt/protostar/bin$
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>So, we see that the program asks for some user input. When we input &amp;lsquo;ABCD&amp;rsquo;, nothing happens. That&amp;rsquo;s a bummer. We need to move to the static analysis to map out our next actions. Remember, it might be easier to look at the source code of the challenge (and it will also not give much away) but we&amp;rsquo;ll still try to avoid source code as much as possible to give more exercise to our brains.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="static-analysis">Static Analysis&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We first run our staple &lt;code>strings&lt;/code> on the program to list interesting text data.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>user@protostar:/opt/protostar/bin$ strings stack4

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>libc.so.6
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>_IO_stdin_used
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>gets
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>puts
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>__libc_start_main
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>GLIBC_2.0
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>PTRh
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">[&lt;/span>^_&lt;span style="color:#f92672">]&lt;/span>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>user@protostar:/opt/protostar/bin$
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>We see a potentially useful string &lt;code>code flow successfully changed&lt;/code> straight away. I&amp;rsquo;d wager a guess that we&amp;rsquo;ve to get our currently dumb program to emit this string somehow. Let&amp;rsquo;s see what is the condition under which this string is being printed. So we bring out gdb like last time and check the disassembled code of main function.&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s interesting. So there&amp;rsquo;s no way main can print the string we&amp;rsquo;re after because there&amp;rsquo;s no print/puts call in here. Interestingly, main makes only one function call to &lt;code>gets&lt;/code> to get user input and there&amp;rsquo;s no other function being called at all. This would mean that the string is being printed from somewhere else and our challenge is to get that code executed. We know from the previous challenge we solved that to print this string, the program would need to pass a pointer to it as a parameter to a output function (like &lt;code>puts&lt;/code>). So to find that where this string is getting printed from, we&amp;rsquo;ve to first the address where this string is located and then search for reference to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You may know that there are various sections in an executable file. Generally, the executable portion is part of a section called &lt;code>.text&lt;/code> and literal strings are part of a section called &lt;code>.rodata&lt;/code>. So, our technique here would be to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Get the section addresses (Using &lt;code>maintenance info sections&lt;/code> gdb command)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Search for the string&amp;rsquo;s address in .rodata section (using &lt;code>find &amp;lt;section_start_address&amp;gt; &amp;lt;section_end_address&amp;gt; &amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/code> gdb command)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Search for a reference to the string&amp;rsquo;s address in .text section (using &lt;code>find &amp;lt;section_start_address&amp;gt; &amp;lt;section_end_address&amp;gt; &amp;lt;string_address&amp;gt;&lt;/code> gdb command)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This is shown below:&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>So, we need to make our program start executing at 0x80483f4 (Entry point of function &lt;code>win&lt;/code>) somehow.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="a-primer-about-x86-stack-frames">A primer about X86 stack frames&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Before continuing further, we will have to learn a bit about how program control works through stack frames. A stack frame is a region on the stack particular to a single function being executed in the call flow and represents its execution environment. If the same function is called many times, each instance of calling that function will have its own stack frame on the stack. A stack frame typically consists of:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Parameters passed to the function&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Return address (Code location to jump to after the function is complete)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pointer to the previous (Calling function&amp;rsquo;s) stack frame&amp;rsquo;s base&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Local variables&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s see with the help of a small example how this works.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="sample-code">Sample Code&lt;/h4>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span> x &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">2&lt;/span>;

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">main&lt;/span>()
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This will compile to the following assembly code&lt;/p>

&lt;h4 id="important-registers">Important registers&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The x86 registers that one would be most interested in while understanding stack frames are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>esp: Stack Pointer. Points to (Holds address of) the current top of the stack&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ebp: Base Pointer. Points to (Holds address of) the base of the current stack frame&lt;/li>
&lt;li>eip: Instruction Pointer. Points to (Holds address of) the next instruction to be executed in the program&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4 id="calling-convention--function-parameters">Calling Convention / Function Parameters&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>In the x86 calling convention, the parameters being passed to a function and the return address are pushed onto the stack before calling it. This can be seen in the below instruction.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-asm" data-lang="asm">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">mov&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">DWORD&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">PTR&lt;/span> [&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">esp&lt;/span>],&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">eax&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">call&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">0x80483ed&lt;/span> &amp;lt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">foo&lt;/span>&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Here, the &lt;code>mov&lt;/code> instruction is pushing the parameter &amp;lsquo;5&amp;rsquo; onto the stack.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;code>call&lt;/code> instruction is equivalent of pushing &lt;code>eip + 2&lt;/code> onto the stack and then jumping to the called function&amp;rsquo;s address. &lt;code>eip + 2&lt;/code> here points to the address of the instruction that should be executed next after returning from the called function.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="function-prologue--entry-sequence">Function Prologue / Entry Sequence&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>At the very beginning of a function, the first work done is to save the calling function&amp;rsquo;s base pointer (ebp) onto the stack and then move the current function&amp;rsquo;s base pointer to point towards calling function&amp;rsquo;s top. This can be seen in these instructions:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-asm" data-lang="asm">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>foo:
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">push&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">ebp&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">mov&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">ebp&lt;/span>,&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">esp&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h4 id="local-variables">Local Variables&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Then, space is created on the stack for holding any local variables.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-asm" data-lang="asm">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">sub&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">esp&lt;/span>,&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">0x10&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h4 id="exit-sequence">Exit Sequence&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Finally, after the function has executed, it returns by restoring the calling function&amp;rsquo;s base pointer and then popping the next value (return address) from stack into the eip.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-asm" data-lang="asm">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">leave&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">ret&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Here, &lt;code>leave&lt;/code> is equivalent of &lt;code>pop ebp&lt;/code> to restore ebp value. &lt;code>ret&lt;/code> is equivalent of &lt;code>pop eip&lt;/code> to start executing the next instruction after the function call.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="what-we-need-to-do">What we need to do&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>From the above analysis of the stack frame, we now know that:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Program flow is controlled through eip register&lt;/li>
&lt;li>On returning from a called function, eip register is updated with a value (return address) from the stack&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If we can somehow overflow a local variable on stack to modify the return address accurately, we can control the program execution.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Note that similar to the function &lt;code>foo&lt;/code>, even the function &lt;code>main&lt;/code> has its own stack frame and returns back to &amp;ldquo;something&amp;rdquo; after completing its execution. This &amp;ldquo;something&amp;rdquo; is the c library runtime against which the compiler linked the program. So we can even try to change execution path by modifying this return address.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4 id="gotchas">Gotchas&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>In some explanations, you may see espmain/StackFramemain in the figure above should also include the parameter being passed to foo. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve excluded it here for the sake of avoiding confusion of overlapping stack frames.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="dynamic-analysis">Dynamic Analysis&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Armed with our static analysis so far, we start our dynamic analysis. So, fire up gdb. We know that &lt;code>main&lt;/code> code is like below:&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>We can see that c runtime (or whatever it is that called the main function even if don&amp;rsquo;t want to get ourselves into what that is) has the base pointer (ebp) as 0xbffff838 and this is preserved at 0xbffff7b8. Then, main updates the current stack pointer (esp) as the new ebp of main. After that, main aligns its esp to 16 byte width, thus wasting 8 bytes and then reserves a further 0x50 (80) bytes for its stack. After all these operations, the salient characteristics of main&amp;rsquo;s stack frame are as below:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Current stack top (esp) is 0xbffff760&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Current base pointer (ebp) is 0xbffff7b8&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Main&amp;rsquo;s calling function&amp;rsquo;s ebp is 0xbffff838 and preserved at 0xbffff7b8&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Main&amp;rsquo;s calling function&amp;rsquo;s return address is saved one word before the ebp (as we know as part of the call instruction of calling program). Thus return address is 0xb7eadc76 as we can see at location 0xbffff7bc (previous_ebp + 0x4 = 0xbffff7b8 + 0x4). This address &lt;code>0xbffff7bc&lt;/code> is the one that we want to overwrite with our intended address of &lt;code>win&lt;/code> function so as to execute that instead of main&amp;rsquo;s caller function.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now, run till the next breakpoint.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">(&lt;/span>gdb&lt;span style="color:#f92672">)&lt;/span> c
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Continuing.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Breakpoint 3, 0x08048418 in main &lt;span style="color:#f92672">(&lt;/span>argc&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>1, argv&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>0xbffff864&lt;span style="color:#f92672">)&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> at stack4/stack4.c:15
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>15 in stack4/stack4.c
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">(&lt;/span>gdb&lt;span style="color:#f92672">)&lt;/span> x $esp
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0xbffff760: 0xbffff770
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">(&lt;/span>gdb&lt;span style="color:#f92672">)&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>So we see that the pointer address for storing the input string from &lt;code>gets&lt;/code> is located at 0xbffff770 (since the argument to &lt;code>gets&lt;/code> is the buffer address and it is passed at the top of the stack as we know from previous section). We can see how far away this is from the address we want to overwrite by subtracting it:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0xbffff7bc - 0xbffff770 &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> 0x4C &lt;span style="color:#f92672">(&lt;/span>or &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">76&lt;/span> bytes&lt;span style="color:#f92672">)&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>So, we know that the difference between our intended location and input buffer address is 76 bytes, so if we input 80 bytes, the 77th-80th bytes will overwrite the return address. We can now go for the win (pun intended) already but let&amp;rsquo;s continue further to our rest of the breakpoints to confirm our theory.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">(&lt;/span>gdb&lt;span style="color:#f92672">)&lt;/span> c

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>

This series is geared towards a structured, but almost completely practical, approach to learn Reverse Engineering. Many of the existing articles/books take a long winded approach to teach RE which is prefixed with a lot of theory before the reader can get their hands dirty. This series will take a different approach of picking up various challenges in the order of increasing difficulty and help the reader in exploring ways how to break them. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to keep mundane theory limited to the portions needed to beat the current challenge in consideration.

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d like to believe that these articles will prove helpful to those who are completely new to the world of reverse engineering. But I hope that even intermediate level readers would be able to make use of these by picking up the articles according to their appropriate levels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pre-requisite for these articles is basic knowledge of programming concepts, prefereably C. Any kind of prior experience with any assembly language is good but not mandatory.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="exploit-exercises--protostar">Exploit Exercises / Protostar&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For the first few articles of this series, we&amp;rsquo;ll work through some of the challenges from &lt;a href="https://exploit-exercises.com">Exploit Exercises&lt;/a>, starting with &lt;a href="https://exploit-exercises.com/protostar/">Protostar&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note that although most of the challenges on exploit exercises provide source code of the challenge, we&amp;rsquo;d try to hack our way using purely reverse engineering as much as possible without looking at the source code. This would lead to better learning and avoid guiding you towards the solution pre-maturely. I strongly recommend that you do not look at the C source unless you&amp;rsquo;ve completed the below artcile fully or are not able to make connection to the assembly code at all after serious effort.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="setup">Setup&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To create the setup, follow the below steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Download the Protostar ISO file from &lt;a href="https://exploit-exercises.com/download/">https://exploit-exercises.com/download/&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Download and install VMWare Workstation Player or VirtualBox&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a new virtual machine in the vm software you downloaded using the nebula ISO from the first step&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The iso is a live CD, so you can boot from it directly, instead of having to install it in the VM&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re all set now to begin&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="stack-0">Stack 0&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://exploit-exercises.com/protostar/stack0/">Stack0&lt;/a> is the first challenge in protostar.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="preparing-for-the-challenge">Preparing for the challenge&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The webpage says that the challenge is located at &lt;code>/opt/protostar/bin/stack0&lt;/code>, so login to the VM and run this program. It looks like it is waiting for some input. On entering any data, it seems to tell us we were wrong with a message &lt;code>Try again?&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>user@protostar:/opt/protostar/bin$ ./stack0
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>asd
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Try again?
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>user@protostar:/opt/protostar/bin$
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>We run &lt;code>strings&lt;/code> command on the stack0 program to find out interesting text present in it, and see another one &lt;code>you have changed the 'modified' variable&lt;/code>, which seems to be our target.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>user@protostar:/opt/protostar/bin$ strings stack0

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>__gmon_start__
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>libc.so.6
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>_IO_stdin_used
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>gets
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>puts
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>__libc_start_main
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>GLIBC_2.0
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>PTRh@
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">[&lt;/span>^_&lt;span style="color:#f92672">]&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>you have changed the &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;modified&amp;#39;&lt;/span> variabley
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Try again?
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>user@protostar:/opt/protostar/bin$
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h3 id="static-analysis">Static Analysis&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Now that we know what we need to achieve, we start our reverse engineering by doing static analysis of the program. There are several utilities to look at the low level code of the program. However, we will be using &lt;code>gdb&lt;/code> here which can help us later in dynamic analysis as well. gdb or The GNU Project Debugger is a popular open source debugger. We&amp;rsquo;ll graduate to more powerful tools or use reverse engineering oriented plugins for gdb later, but for now a vanilla gdb will do. It is already installed in the protostar VM. A debugger allows us to examine the internal state of the program as it executes at instruction/register level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some of the important commands that you&amp;rsquo;d use during the static analysis for this challenge are:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>set disassembly-flavor intel&lt;/code>: While this is optional, but it allows to see the disassembled code in a more readable format.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>disassemble &amp;lt;function&amp;gt;&lt;/code>: This command displays the disassembled code of &lt;code>function&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can read more about these commands at &lt;a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/">https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="http://visualgdb.com/gdbreference/commands/">http://visualgdb.com/gdbreference/commands/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using the above information, we load the &lt;code>stack0&lt;/code> executable in GDB and disassemble the function &lt;code>main&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h4 id="making-sense-of-the-assembly-code">Making sense of the assembly code&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Well, so we got a&amp;hellip;.big pile of gibberish? So, this is how assembly code looks like. Very different from a regular C program, as you can see. On the left side, you can see the memory addresses where a particular instruction is present and on the right side the instruction. Each instruction is again composed of two parts:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The instruction itself&lt;/li>
&lt;li>0 or more operands (which can be addresses or registers with some specific formatting that we will learn as we encounter it)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now, although this is a small enough program, as good reverse engineers, we rarely go through the whole program immediately which would require us to know each assembly instruction as well as take a lot of time. So, instead we will make some intelligent guesses and look at only the instructions/code that we really need to know. Just know these basic things before moving forward:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Any instruction that works on some data either takes one or more addresses and/or registers as operands, which it operates on&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A register like eax is a basically a temporary/scratch memory close to the CPU for getting fast access to a data being used locally frequently&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There are few special registers. For current problem, know that ebp is the Stack Base pointer or the bottom of current stack frame, esp is the stack pointer or the current top of the stack, eip is the instruction pointer or the address of the instruction which is just about to be executed. We&amp;rsquo;ll learn more about the ebp/esp when we do a real stack overflow problem&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A square bracket &lt;code>[]&lt;/code> around a address or register signifies that the instruction refers to the value present in that address/register as the source or destination of the operation instead of the address/register itself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For most operations involving a source and destination operand, the left operand is the destination.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If you face problem in understanding the below information and think you need to understand x86 assembly a bit more before moving forward, you can use this very short and simple guide for the same: &lt;a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs216/guides/x86.html">https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs216/guides/x86.html&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many times, my first intuition is to find out the areas in code which lead to our success/failure cases and work backwards from there. From our preparation phase, we saw that the failure case printed a message &lt;code>Try again?&lt;/code> on the screen and the success case was potentially a message &lt;code>you have changed the 'modified' variable&lt;/code>. Skimming over the code quickly, you will notice 3 peculiar statements that you may already be familiar from your C programming.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0x0804840c &amp;lt;main+24&amp;gt;: call 0x804830c &amp;lt;gets@plt&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>...
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0x08048420 &amp;lt;main+44&amp;gt;: call 0x804832c &amp;lt;puts@plt&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>...
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0x0804842e &amp;lt;main+58&amp;gt;: call 0x804832c &amp;lt;puts@plt&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>If you don&amp;rsquo;t remember what &lt;code>gets&lt;/code> and &lt;code>puts&lt;/code> do, you can look at their descriptions from their manpages (e.g. &lt;code>man puts&lt;/code>). In brief, &lt;code>gets&lt;/code> allows you to capture user input from stdin and &lt;code>puts&lt;/code> allows you to print output to stdout to display to the user. This matches with our observations in the previous section that it waited for user input when we ran the program and gave an error message on receiving the input. We also saw a 2nd string which was potentially the success message. So we have 1 gets and 2 puts statements corresponding to this, but we don&amp;rsquo;t know yet which one of the 2 puts statements is the success part and which one is the failure part.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyways, we start moving a bit backwards from the first puts statement and try to make sense of each instruction:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0x08048420 &amp;lt;main+44&amp;gt;: call 0x804832c &amp;lt;puts@plt&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Here, the &lt;code>call&lt;/code> instruction refers to calling a function specified by the address 0x804832c. The string inside &amp;lt;&amp;gt; is the disassembler telling you the symbol name associated with that address.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0x08048419 &amp;lt;main+37&amp;gt;: mov DWORD PTR &lt;span style="color:#f92672">[&lt;/span>esp&lt;span style="color:#f92672">]&lt;/span>,0x8048500
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Here, the &lt;code>mov&lt;/code> instruction is moving the value 0x8048500 into the address pointed by the register esp. The X86 calling convention puts the arguments to a function onto the stack before calling it and here the esp is the &amp;ldquo;Stack pointer&amp;rdquo; register. So, this must be the address of the string being passed to puts that it must print. Keep this address 0x8048500 in mind for our next section (Dynamic Analysis).&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0x08048411 &amp;lt;main+29&amp;gt;: mov eax,DWORD PTR &lt;span style="color:#f92672">[&lt;/span>esp+0x5c&lt;span style="color:#f92672">]&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0x08048415 &amp;lt;main+33&amp;gt;: test eax,eax
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0x08048417 &amp;lt;main+35&amp;gt;: je 0x8048427 &amp;lt;main+51&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Here we see that first we move some data from the address esp + 0x5c into eax. then the &lt;code>test&lt;/code> instruction checks whether eax is zero or not. It does this by AND&amp;rsquo;ing the left and right operand. Since eax is the left as well as the right operand, the AND result will be zero only if eax is zero. Then the &lt;code>je&lt;/code> (or jump if equal to) instruction will jump the program execution to the address 0x8048427 (i.e. it will skip the first puts statement and start executing near our 2nd puts statement) if eax was zero. Otherwise it will execute the first puts statement. It decides the &amp;ldquo;equal to&amp;rdquo; condition by looking at an internal flag called Zero Flag (or Z or ZF) and treats equals condition to be true if this flag is set. This is because a &lt;code>test&lt;/code> or a &lt;code>cmp&lt;/code> (compare) instruction will set the ZF to 1 if result of the AND of 2 operands (in case of test) or difference of 2 operands (in case of cmp) was 0.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This seems like our decision maker code as if we can manipulate the value at [esp+0x5c] then we can control the flow of the program to either of the puts statements. So, let&amp;rsquo;s keep this address in mind for our dynamic analysis.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0x08048405 &amp;lt;main+17&amp;gt;: lea eax,&lt;span style="color:#f92672">[&lt;/span>esp+0x1c&lt;span style="color:#f92672">]&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0x08048409 &amp;lt;main+21&amp;gt;: mov DWORD PTR &lt;span style="color:#f92672">[&lt;/span>esp&lt;span style="color:#f92672">]&lt;/span>,eax
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0x0804840c &amp;lt;main+24&amp;gt;: call 0x804830c &amp;lt;gets@plt&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Finally we reach the user input call. &lt;code>lea&lt;/code> instruction means &amp;ldquo;Load effective address&amp;rdquo;. It is a slightly tricky instruction in the sense that:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>it does the calculations only on the right side operand, not both and then stores the result in left operand&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the square brackets [] don&amp;rsquo;t really refer to the meaning that we know from other instructions (i.e. you dont need to find out further the value present at calculated address and can just ignore the [])&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Combining this knowledge with the semantics of mov/call that we learnt earlier, we know that the program is collecting the user input and storing that into a location starting at esp+0x1c.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0x080483fd &amp;lt;main+9&amp;gt;: mov DWORD PTR &lt;span style="color:#f92672">[&lt;/span>esp+0x5c&lt;span style="color:#f92672">]&lt;/span>,0x0
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>And then we come to this instruction which looks a bit familiar to us because we&amp;rsquo;ve already seen that address esp+0x5c earlier. So, this seems like the initialization statement for a variable which is set to 0 and then later checked whether it is still 0 or not.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-vulnerability">The vulnerability&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Our task then is to make this variable (at location esp+0x5c) 0 or non-zero depending on what do the 2 puts statements do. The only access to influence the program we have is through the input we can give to &lt;code>gets&lt;/code>. Hmm, so we dig deeper into the gets manpage and we see below:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>gets() reads a line from stdin into the buffer pointed to by s until either a terminating newline or EOF, which it replaces with a null byte (&amp;#39;\0&amp;#39;). No check for buffer overrun is performed (see BUGS below).
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Great! So we know that we need to update a value at address esp+0x5c and we know that we have a possibility to have unchecked writes done starting from esp+0x1c. You know where this is going, and we almost don&amp;rsquo;t even need further dynamic analysis to crack this now. But I&amp;rsquo;ll take you through a bit of dynamic analysis for a brief introduction to it and for confirming our theory.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="dynamic-analysis">Dynamic Analysis&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>While in static analysis we carry out all our inspections without running the program, in dynamic analysis we monitor the internal state of the program while it is running. For this, we will run the program inside gdb. You should know the following basic commands for this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>r&lt;/code>: Run the currently loaded program from beginning&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>b *&amp;lt;address&amp;gt;&lt;/code>: Put a breakpoint at &amp;lt;address&amp;gt; so that the program stops execution when it reaches that address.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>c&lt;/code>: Continue execution&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>info r&lt;/code>: This displays the current state of the CPU&amp;rsquo;s general purpose registers&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>x/&amp;lt;n&amp;gt;&amp;lt;s&amp;gt; &amp;lt;address/register&amp;gt;&lt;/code>: This allows to examine the process memory at the given address or address contained in register. You can use various switches &amp;lt;s&amp;gt; with it to display a specific amount of memory and in a specific format. e.g., /i displays the memory as instructions, /x as hex, /s as strings, etc. The number &amp;lt;n&amp;gt; is used to display n units of memory&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, before we run the program, recall that we had 2 puts calls in our assembly code and we didn&amp;rsquo;t know which one was the success case and which was failure. So we simply try to read the strings present at the addresses which were passed to the puts calls.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">(&lt;/span>gdb&lt;span style="color:#f92672">)&lt;/span> x/s 0x8048500
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0x8048500: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;you have changed the &amp;#39;modified&amp;#39; variable&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">(&lt;/span>gdb&lt;span style="color:#f92672">)&lt;/span> x/s 0x8048529
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0x8048529: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;Try again?&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">(&lt;/span>gdb&lt;span style="color:#f92672">)&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>So we knnow that our first puts call is the success case and the second one is failure. Now, our observation was that if the value at esp+0x5c was 0, then it goes to the second puts call and otherwise it goes to first. So, we have to somehow make this value non-zero to get success.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We know that our area of interest is in the gets call through which we can manipulate the program memory. So let&amp;rsquo;s put couple of breakpoints, 1 before gets and 1 after and then run the program.&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>We entered &lt;code>AAAAAAAAAAAA&lt;/code> as the input, i.e., 12 &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; characters as input and notice that 12 bytes starting from 0xbffff76c onwards now reflect as 0x41 (which is the &lt;a href="http://www.asciitable.com/">ascii value&lt;/a> of A). So if we enter more number of As, we can continue overwriting more memory locations with 0x41 till we reach esp+0x5c. We can find the distance between the input variable and output variable addresses by doing this simple calculation of (esp+0x5c - esp+0x1c) or (0xbffff7ac - 0xbffff76c) which comes out to be 0x40 or 64. So, we need to input more than 64 As into the program to modify the variable and get the desired result.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Try this out now on regular command line:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>So, in this article, we learnt:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>About a very basic buffer overflow on the stack and how to exploit it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Static and dynamic analysis portions of reverse engineering&lt;/li>
&lt;li>strings command&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Introduction to x86 assembly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Several gdb commands&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We also learnt that usage of &lt;code>gets&lt;/code> function is very dangerous as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any kind of check on the amount of input coming from the user versus the space we have to save it.&lt;/li>

&lt;h1 id="email-actions">email-actions&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>email-actions is a tiny SMTP server with a rules based engine to trigger any actions (notifications/commands etc) based on the emails sent to this server.
Think of it like &lt;a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT&lt;/a> but where input trigger is email and can be set up and run locally as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="why-did-you-make-email-actions">Why did you make email-actions&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Like most of my projects, email-actions is a &amp;lsquo;scratch-your-own-itch&amp;rsquo; project. I bought a NAS (Synology ds216j) which also doubled as a downloader of anime/tv shows etc through RSS using its inbuilt &amp;ldquo;Download Station&amp;rdquo; app. I also used Plex to watch them over the network but these needed to be moved to a proper folder and named in a specific format (and some crap deleted and other maintenance done or sometimes some post processing done) to have Plex display/play them properly. I used Filebot and a few custom scripts for this but had to either do this manually or use a fixed time task scheduling (which tended to delay watching). This was semi-irritating.
I also wanted to know when something had been downloaded so I could binge on that latest episode as soon as it was done :)
Download station had a hack (by changing internal files) to run custom script after a download was completed but it had to be redone after every firmware update and sometimes, after every restart. And finally it stopped working altogether with recent updates.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>Releasing my project &lt;a href="https://github.com/shantanugoel/email-actions">email-actions&lt;/a> today.

&lt;p>It did support email notifications though. Thus email-actions was born. So I could push notifications for downloaded items run my custom scripts on the downloaded items.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve started using it for many other things as email is pervasive and most of the devices support email based notifications. So I can trap them and carry out other actions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="what-are-the-benefitsdifferences-compared-to-hosted-services-like-ifttt">What are the benefits/differences compared to hosted services like IFTTT&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>IFTTT provides email hooks as well. I &lt;em>think&lt;/em> email-actions may be an alternative (you can decide whether it&amp;rsquo;s better or not) with respect to below:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>IFTTT works as a client once email is received so you still need an available SMTP server to be able to send email. This can be expensive or risky as you&amp;rsquo;d have to share your server username/pwd to the email sending entity. email-actions is an SMTP server that takes actions before any actual email delivery.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Can be run locally with minimal dependencies. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to send your data to internet or even have an internet connection&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tiny footprint&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Can run local commands as well while IFTTT still needs to be integrated with something else if that&amp;rsquo;s what you need&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You are in control of your info&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Free(er), that is, no limitations on hooks/conditions etc&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="current-high-level-feature-list">Current high level feature list&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>aiosmtpd based for aync email processing for performance&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The action execution is also asyncio based, so will free up the email sender while processing the action in background&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Easy yaml based configuration&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Global or local variables for full customization/reuse&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Action decision based on &amp;ldquo;To&amp;rdquo; email address filtering (Addition of many other filters on the roadmap)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Plugins supported:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://joaoapps.com/join/">Join&lt;/a> push notifications (Will add pushbullet if there&amp;rsquo;s a demand or can use custom external script for now)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Custom Local commands (Any arguments, any script type, custom environment variables)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Email (Can forward the email to custom upstream servers further if needed for more actions or actual email delivery)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="installation">Installation&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Pre-requisites: You need Python 3.4+ to be able to run this&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Install using pip (May need to use &lt;code>pip3&lt;/code> instead of &lt;code>pip&lt;/code> according to your OS/python installation. May need to use &lt;code>sudo&lt;/code> prefix before below command if installing system wide)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;code>pip install email-actions&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Install directly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Specify config file (yaml format) to be used. If it
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> doesn&amp;#39;t exist, we&amp;#39;ll try to create it
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Examples:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>email_actions -H 127.0.0.1 -p 8500 -l 2 -c /home/shantanu/email_actions_cfg.yml
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>email_actions -c /home/shantanu/email_actions_cfg.yml
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Most of the options above are self explanatory. If you don&amp;rsquo;t specify a hostname, it will choose &lt;code>localhost&lt;/code> by default. If you don&amp;rsquo;t specify a port, it&amp;rsquo;ll choose &lt;code>8025&lt;/code> by default.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note&lt;/strong> I recommend running the server on localhost or an internal network interface so that it can&amp;rsquo;t be abused from internet. Right now it doesn&amp;rsquo;t support authentication (limitation of aiosmtpd. Will be fixed soon), so if you must open it up to the internet, add your own scheme of verification either through a randomly generated email address in &amp;ldquo;To&amp;rdquo; rule or some other check in subject/content in your own external script that you are triggering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Specifying a config file is mandatory. If the specified file doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist, we&amp;rsquo;ll generate a dummy one which you can fill. But essentially this is a step that you can&amp;rsquo;t avoid. The config file is explained in more detail below.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="config-file-format">Config file format&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>email-actions uses the simple &lt;code>yaml&lt;/code> format for its configuration. Learning this is a small task (few minutes at most for the basic usage that we need). You can look at &lt;a href="https://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/yaml">this page&lt;/a> for a quick reference.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>email-actions works on the basis of user specified &lt;code>filters&lt;/code>. Each filter can have &lt;code>rules&lt;/code> specified which decide whether to run an action or not on the incoming email. Each filter also specifies &lt;code>actions&lt;/code> (which is 1 or more plugins) to run an action on the incoming email if it passes the &lt;code>rules&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At least 1 filter is necessary in the configuration. Each filter must have at least 1 action. Rest all is optional. Each action plugin may have it&amp;rsquo;s own mandatory OR optional settings. See &lt;a href="#plugin-settings">Plugin Settings&lt;/a> for all available plugins and their options/variables&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The config file has the following general format. All text after &lt;code>#&lt;/code> is an explanation, not a part of the config itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Names within &lt;code>&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code> can be substituted by user as per their choice. Names outside &lt;code>&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code> are reserved by email-actions and must be used as is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All settings are case-sensitive. So take care of that.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Feel free to fork the repo and send PRs for any changes. If you can&amp;rsquo;t make changes but want to report issues or provide feedback, open an Issue on github or ping me on twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/shantanugoel">@shantanugoel&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can contribute either to the core or write a plugin for your usecase. The only guiding principle is to keep it as simple/minimal as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-write-a-plugin">How to write a plugin&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Take a look at any plugin in &lt;a href="https://github.com/shantanugoel/email-actions/tree/master/email_actions/plugins">plugins&lt;/a> directory
A minimal plugin needs to do following things:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Define &amp;lsquo;PLUGIN_NAME&amp;rsquo;. This need not be same as the file name but is preferred to keep that way&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A function that takes these parameters: &lt;code>filter_name, msg_from, msg_to, msg_subject, msg_content&lt;/code> and doesn&amp;rsquo;t return anything&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Read plugin&amp;rsquo;s configuration (if any) using email_actions.config.read_config_plugin function
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Ideally the plugin should not need to use any other function from the core&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After writing the plugin, add the plugin&amp;rsquo;s name and entry function in &lt;code>entry_funcs&lt;/code> dict in &lt;a href="https://github.com/shantanugoel/email-actions/tree/master/email_actions/plugins/__init__.py">plugins init file&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;p>We talked earlier about how certain &lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/2016/09/17/indian-isp-act-fibernet-blocks-bit-ly-does-dns-hijacking/">ISPs block websites by using DNS hijack methods&lt;/a> and I had recommended using DNSCrypt to bypass it. Well, as part of my home network overhaul, I moved over from the consumer grade (but still decent enough) Asus router over to Ubiquiti stack which, among other things, lead me to use their &amp;ldquo;Unify Security Gateway (USG)&amp;rdquo; as the router. Now, this router is pretty decent and is running Ubiquiti&amp;rsquo;s EdgeOS (derived from Vyatta OS, which in turn is based on linux/debian). You can install and tweak a lot of stuff through command line if you&amp;rsquo;d like but alas there&amp;rsquo;s no dnscrypt-proxy available for it.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;h2 id="the-background">The Background&lt;/h2>

You can install and tweak a lot of stuff through command line if you&amp;rsquo;d like but alas there&amp;rsquo;s no dnscrypt-proxy available for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had the below options now to overcome my ISP&amp;rsquo;s DNS hijacking:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Compile dnscrypt manually and use it&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Run dnscrypt on another server/device internally (maybe my NAS or the ubiquiti cloudkey or something)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Use one of the other options I had originally discussed (hosts file, VPN, alternate port)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I rejected the first option as it meant setting up a cross compilation environment just for one program and also it may be hard to keep up in future. The 2nd option wasn&amp;rsquo;t too good either as I didn&amp;rsquo;t want my network infrastructure&amp;rsquo;s basic need of DNS to depend on another device which may not be as resilient due to other regular use. From the other earlier discussed alternatives, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to do the manual upkeep of hosts file or fall into the expensive/slow/insecure trap of VPNs. So I settled on the next best solution of using an alternate port for my DNS queries, with the hope that the ISP is dumb (or cost conscious) enough to rely only on port number to higjack DNS and not use DPI for it (even though &lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/2017/01/24/act-fibernet-deep-packet-inspection-blocking-sites/">they do use DPI for at least some types of blocking&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="testing-the-waters">Testing the Waters&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First thing was to try whether this would even work or not. So I tried it easily by querying for a blocked torrent site first through ISP&amp;rsquo;s DNS servers, then OpenDNS servers on default DNS port (53) and then Open DNS servers on port 5353 (Yes, OpenDNS responds to dns queries on 5353 as well, fortunately.)&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="left" >
&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/2017/03/dns-queries-thumb.jpg" />
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>In the first 2 attempts, the IP returned was my ISP&amp;rsquo;s hijacked reply (pointing to their own generic server that they use to respond to blocked site requests) but in the last one (using port 5353), the DNS request went unmodified and came back with the real IP of the website. Success!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="configuring-the-usg">Configuring the USG&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>So, on to the real deal. USG does have a UI option in the Unify Controller software to set custom DNS servers. However, it takes only IPs and not ports. This is understandable as I found out after going through resolv.conf manpages and several old discussions. resolv.conf&amp;rsquo;s support for alternate ports has been discussed several times and rejected in favor of other system wide solutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had a thought to use iptables to forward all requests going out to WAN port 53 to port 5353. But, this is like using a shotgun to pop balloons. Firewall solutions like this should be used rarely as they strain the traffic processing as they build up quickly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>USG uses dnsmasq though, so there was hope. DNSmasq allows to set ports as well for nameservers as per its manpage. So, the problem statement was thus as below:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t use resolv.conf at all (to avoid ISP&amp;rsquo;s DNS servers or any other DNS servers leaking traffic onto port 53)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Set OpenDNS nameserver ip/port in dnsmasq for all sites (Generally folks use it for specific sites, but the configuration syntax is flexible enough to mould it anyways and we can set it as a generic server too)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s no UI option for this though, so you&amp;rsquo;ve to drop down to the CLI. Launch an ssh session to the USG ip and use the credentials that you&amp;rsquo;ve set in the unify controller to log in. Then run the below set of commands. The procedure is slightly different from a regular linux box (where you&amp;rsquo;d directly edit dnsmasq.conf) due to the specific nature of config management of ubiquiti devices.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span># Switch to configuration mode
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$ configure
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span># Below commands will generate the appropriate dnsmasq.conf automaticall
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span># Don&amp;#39;t use resolve.conf
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$ set service dns forwarding options &amp;#34;no-resolv&amp;#34;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span># Set the opendns nameserver for all sites
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$ set service dns forwarding options &amp;#34;server=208.67.222.222#5353&amp;#34;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span># Generate the config files, save and exit
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$ commit;save;exit
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now, you can try browsing (or doing nslookup) for the blocked website and it&amp;rsquo;ll go through succesfully. Note that like all other CLI changes for USG, the above changes can be lost whenever you make some other config change through UI or update USG firmware. To make it persistent across such events, you need to follow the &lt;a href="https://help.ubnt.com/hc/en-us/articles/215458888-UniFi-How-to-further-customize-USG-configuration-with-config-gateway-json">config.gateway json process&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>ACT Fibernet blocks sites using deep packet inspection</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2017/01/24/act-fibernet-deep-packet-inspection-blocking-sites/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jan 2017 16:04:28 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2017/01/24/act-fibernet-deep-packet-inspection-blocking-sites/</guid><description>&lt;p>ISPs in India have been blocking websites since many years.

They are now doing deep packet inspection to find out the sites that I am visiting and thus block them by stopping the responses to my requests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few days ago, there were a few tweets mentioning that &lt;a href="streamable.com">Streamable&lt;/a> was blocked by few Indian ISPs. While checking it out, I noticed that I was not able to access it either on ACT ISP. I tried pinging the site and a traceroute to it and it seemed to work fine with no anomalies which puzzled me. Then I tried using https to access the site, and it opened up fine. This meant that ACT isn&amp;rsquo;t blocking the access based on the dns but by looking at something in my packets and so using https bypassed it (due to encryption of the data lying within).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I further tried doing the same through curl and found that if I fake the &amp;ldquo;Host&amp;rdquo; header in the command, I could access streamable.com even through http. A few other tests confirmed that ACT actually does a partial match for the blocked site because it blocked host headers like fakestreamable.com or streamable.com.in etc as well. But using something like &amp;ldquo;fake.com&amp;rdquo; worked. You can try this with below command and vary the site name after &amp;ldquo;Host:&amp;rdquo; in the command.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>curl -L -g -4 -v --header &amp;quot;Host: streamable.com&amp;quot; streamable.com&lt;/code>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>TLDR;&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Indian ISP ACT Fibernet (aka Beam Telecom) hijacks its users&amp;rsquo; DNS requests (even when using public DNS servers like Google or OpenDNS) and blocks websites through this method. This has huge implications beyond website blocking and you can&amp;rsquo;t rely on anything that you are browsing anymore though there are ways available to make yourself safe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Aside: Indian ISPs are blocking benign/collateral damage sites now like bit.ly for ACT and behance.net for Airtel. Pretty soon most of web will be blocked in India at this rate.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;h2 id="hahahugoshortcode271s0hbhb">

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update:&lt;/strong> It seems that some folks on ACT do not see the block/DNS hijack. So far, they all seem to be on dynamic IP. It could be either that the hijacking is being done only for static IP folks or for specific IP ranges. Please comment here or tweet to me @shantanugoel if you are on ACT but do not see the block and/or dns hijack.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update 2:&lt;/strong> Got a call from ACT team and they&amp;rsquo;ve unblocked bit.ly this morning. However, DNS hijacking, the primary problem, still seems to be there for many users.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>But the rage didn&amp;rsquo;t stop at this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I tried the usual way of adding &amp;ldquo;https&amp;rdquo; to bypass the block but it was highly unusual to see another error which said bit.ly closed my connection. I was sure bit.ly supports https as I could see on my Airtel connection. So this was weird.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet">&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr">Well, I&amp;#39;ll be damned :o bit.ly is pointing to &lt;a href="https://t.co/Yp6tdKp23o">https://t.co/Yp6tdKp23o&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/thTD2dvEv3">pic.twitter.com/thTD2dvEv3&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&amp;mdash; Shantanu Goel (@shantanugoel) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/shantanugoel/status/777081685305270272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 17, 2016&lt;/a>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>This &amp;ldquo;might&amp;rdquo; have been okay/explained away if I was using my ISP&amp;rsquo;s DNS servers (even though it&amp;rsquo;d be unethical in my book even then). But I was NOT using ISP&amp;rsquo;s DNS servers in the first place (who does that, seriously?).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was using google&amp;rsquo;s public DNS servers at my router as well as PC level and resolve.conf is set to use localhost. So I was pretty sure I am using the google dns and I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have got a fake IP back. &lt;strong>This was an even bigger red flag!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I ran the nslookup on bit.ly through an online service and it gave me the correct bit.ly server IPs but running nslookup on my PC or even on my router gave me back the fake IP.

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>This is how (bad) ISPs do this. They look for all traffic on port 53 (the DNS port) and don&amp;rsquo;t let them go to the actual DNS server and fulfill it from their own DNS servers, thus forcing you to go to a location of their bidding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my case, I tried running the various &amp;ldquo;DNS leak tests&amp;rdquo;/&amp;ldquo;Transparent Proxy detection&amp;rdquo; tests but they all came out fine. Because my ISP is doing something clever here. I am assuming that they look at all the addresses that you are trying to reach, and then serve the ones they are interested in from their servers while passing on the rest of the requests to your originally intended dns server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How these tests work is that they see your IP, then ask your browser to connect to some specific server (like 7325abcd.mydnsleaktest.com) and see the IP which is actually touching their dns servers to query that address. I looked at these results and they all showed google to be the one connecting to them and so that seemed fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Luckily, my ISP is not doing this (cannot do this?) for the opendns test and it detected the proxying immediately.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="implicationshow-to-protect-yourself">Implications/How to protect yourself&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The situation is grim now because your ISP can control everything you visit on the internet and you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even know. You could be sending all your searches to your ISP, giving your passwords to them through fake sites, or they could silently replace the script/css etc servers and track all of your behavior, the implications are endless.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But all is not lost. There are a few ways to protect yourself from this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Add the IP manually to your hosts file&lt;/strong>: (H/T https://twitter.com/electron0zero). This is the simplest way as it will bypass even connecting to DNS server at all. But is cumbersome as you have to manually add each site and also update it if the IP changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Get a VPN.&lt;/strong> I prefer this the least though because it is expensive, slow, and in general problematic to setup everywhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>**Reroute your DNS requests to some other non-standard port. **You will need to have a bit of iptables know-how for this and a router good enough to give you this access. But your ISP can&amp;rsquo;t (?) monitor every port for DNS traffic. Theoretically they could though.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Use DNSCrypt&lt;/strong>. This is my recommended method and what I chose to save myself. This is good in future as well to save you from other DNS attacks. From DNScrypt.org&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>DNSCrypt is a protocol that authenticates communications between a DNS client and a DNS resolver. It prevents DNS spoofing. It uses cryptographic signatures to verify that responses originate from the chosen DNS resolver and haven&amp;rsquo;t been tampered with.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Depending on your machines/routers, it can range from easy to difficult. On my Asus RT-N66U with custom firmware, all it took was one line of opkg command to install it and another few lines to start it up at boot and configure dnsmasq to use it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="closing">Closing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not closed yet. I am talking to my ISP to figure this out and see if they will accept removing this kind of malpractice (I don&amp;rsquo;t think they will. But one has to try!). Please do share this to raise awareness. If you have any queries or any other information about this, please do get in touch with me on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/shantanugoel">@shantanugoel&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As an aside, this also means that there is an order out to block bit.ly as well and other ISPs may follow suite soon :|&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>NTP Driver For ESP8266</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2015/03/01/ntp-driver-for-esp8266/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2015 08:02:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2015/03/01/ntp-driver-for-esp8266/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m building a smartwatch project based around the new IoT posterkid on the block, ESP8266.

The experience during the commute daily was underwhelming. Couple the spotty airtel data connection with no one station covering all songs I would love and it makes for a frustrating commute with long gaps all over. Slacker has a radio station caching feature but unfortunately doesn&amp;rsquo;t support India. So I took things into my own hands and Shoutcast2Dropbox was born this weekend. Details follow below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Link: &lt;a href="https://github.com/shantanugoel/Shoutcast2Dropbox">https://github.com/shantanugoel/Shoutcast2Dropbox&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="shoutcast2dropbox---automatic-shoutcast-stations-to-dropbox-recorder">&lt;strong>Shoutcast2Dropbox - Automatic Shoutcast Stations To Dropbox Recorder&lt;/strong>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This simple script allows to automatically download a specified duration of song collections from different shoutcast stations and then automatically upload them to your dropbox. This can be used to create your own station caching feature with a variety of benefits:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Individual songs instead of one lengthy stream so you can skip forward/backwards among them&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mix up a variety of different stations instead of listening to a single type (e.g. I mix up different types of rock and metal stations with a few latest hits ones thrown in)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No buffering/precious mobile data usage as the Dropbox folder can be synced to phone on wifi (I use Dropsync to schedule syncs on home wifi)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>New playlist every day instead of listening to same old stored songs&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I created this for myself one day as I was sick of the many issues that plague streaming music (the ones listed above that are overcome with this script). It may have bugs or may not cover all usecases. I&amp;rsquo;d love to get feedback to fix the bugs and add more features, so feel free to send in your requests.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="dependencies">&lt;strong>Dependencies&lt;/strong>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>For the script:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Linux Host - (PC/Router/Raspberry Pi/Server etc). Script is written for shell currently but may be adapted for windows. I run it on my router as a cronjob.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>streamripper - Opensource Shoutcast recorder program&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dropbox Uploader - For Dropbox sync. Linked as submodule in this git repository.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h1 id="usage">&lt;strong>Usage&lt;/strong>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Once above dependencies are satisfied, run the Dropbox Uploader script and do the steps as mentioned to create a folder for syncing the songs to your Dropbox.
After that, you can run the Shoutcast2Dropbox script as below:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>./Shoutcast2Dropbox.sh &amp;lt;Input File for station lists&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Cumulative Duration to record in seconds&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Output Directory path&amp;gt; &lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Input file should have 1 station url per line. An example file (stations-example.txt) is given in this repository
Duration in seconds is split up into equal durations for each station. e.g. 3600 seconds (1 hour) given here with a station list of 3 means each station will be recorded for 1200 seconds (or 20 minutes).
Output directory is where the songs will be captured to.
Example:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>./Shoutcast2Dropbox.sh stations-example.txt 3600 /home/Shantanu/songs &lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sync the folder to your phone (See tips section ;) )&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="tips">&lt;strong>Tips&lt;/strong>&lt;/h1>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Station urls are not the website urls. You need to get their actual shoutcast stream urls. If they are not present on the website in plain view, generally you can &amp;ldquo;inspect&amp;rdquo; the web page or view source to find those out.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Use aac streams if possible. They are lower size and higher quality compared to mp3s&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Instead of running the script manually, set it up as a cron job to run automatically. I set it up to run every day around noon (so that songs get downloaded by the time I reach home)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Set it up on a low power device which is always on. e.g. I set it up on my router.
i) I had to install a few extras on my router for this to work (e.g. coreutils-stat pkg from entware). You may need to do so as well
ii) I used -k option in script for Dropbox Uploader due to missing ca certificates. You may either choose to install certificates (not a problem on PC but slightly involved on router) or use -k option wherever dropbox uploader commands are used. Didn&amp;rsquo;t check in the k option to avoid security issues by default.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>For listening to fresh playlists every day while on the road with least effort, setup your phone to automatically sync this. I use &amp;ldquo;DropSync&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Tasker&amp;rdquo; for this. DropSync allows to sync any dropbox folder to the phone and tasker automates this process while taking care of not disturbing your normal phone use. I set it up like this:
a. Setup DropSync to do only manual sync.
b. In Tasker, create a profile with this conditions:
i) An hourly repeating time event from 10 PM to 6 AM
ii) Wifi is connected instead of mobile data
iii) Location context is home (from another of my profiles. You can instead choose to use your specific home wifi ssid in above step)
iv) Phone is getting charged (so that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t lose power in the middle)
c. Profile enter task is setup to check a variable if sync is done or not. If not done, then trigger the sync and then set the sync done variable.
d. Profile exit task is setup to clear the sync done variable for next day.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol></content></item><item><title>Browser controlled Raspberry Pi Camera Car</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2014/08/03/browser-controlled-raspberry-pi-camera-car/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Aug 2014 15:33:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2014/08/03/browser-controlled-raspberry-pi-camera-car/</guid><description>&lt;p>Spent this weekend building a remote controlled car with a live camera feed with a Raspberry Pi doing the communication and brains duty.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>HW Used:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Dagu Chassis (Includes motors/tires and the plates)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dagu Pan/Tilt kit (Servos and brackets to mount the camera)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dagu Mini Driver (Arduino clone + Motor driver)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Raspberry Pi (Model B but any could be used)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A netgear ethernet to wifi adapter (Since I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the raspi cam so had to save a USB port and use this instead of USB wifi adapter)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A cheap old USB webcam&lt;/li>
&lt;li>6 AA Cells&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A sony portable charger to power the raspberry pi and wifi adapter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wires/Screws/Spacers/Tools (lots of them)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Features:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Control the car from any browser&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Can control motion as well as camera pan/tilt from browser using virtual joysticks (Requires multitouch to do pan/tilt as second joystick is needed for this)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Streams back video from car camera to the browser&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Can rotate left/right while being completely stationary&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Can have multiple connections to the car (not recommended for controlling)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Uses websockets for control and response is almost instantaneous like regular toy cars.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Responsive touch-anywhere joysticks using virtualjoystick (&lt;a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/virtualjoystick.js">https://github.com/jeromeetienne/virtualjoystick.js&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>HW Setup overview:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Raspberry Pi connects to the USB webcam and Dagu Mini driver through second USB port (for serial comm)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Raspberry Pi powered by micro USB through portable charger&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>DAGU mini driver powered through a 6 AA battery pack (which powers the motors/servos as well)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Servos connected to Digital Pins 2 and 4&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Motors connected to Pins 8-11&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Wifi adapter powered through portable charger and connected to Pi through ethernet port&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SW Setup Overview:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Use any Raspberry Pi software image. I used vanilla raspbian&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Get all my code from my github: &lt;a href="https://github.com/shantanugoel/raspi-car">https://github.com/shantanugoel/raspi-car&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Compile and start mjpg-streamer using mjpg-streamer.sh (Compilation not needed if using my repo as I included a compiled version of mjpg-streamer and needed plugins)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Start websockets and Dagu communication driver back end: controller.py (python controller.py)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Open browser to &lt;code>http://rpi:8090&lt;/code> (or &lt;code>http://&amp;lt;RaspberryPiIPAddress&amp;gt;:8090&lt;/code>) from any device&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Touch anywhere to start controlling the car. Left half of screen corresponds to car movement joystick. Right half of screen corresponds to camera pan/tilt joystick. You can use either one of them or both simultaneously.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Some Important Points:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Found that you can&amp;rsquo;t use standard Servo library along with DC motors as it disables the PWM on pins 9 &amp;amp; 10 as it uses Timer 1 (Should have read the manual in the first place :| )&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Used ServoTimer2 library to avoid this (since it uses timer 2) but it didn&amp;rsquo;t compile. Got it compiling and is added to my github repo as well so you can use it too.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>ServoTimer2 disables use of digital pin 3 for servo. So had to use pin 4 for tilt&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Raspberry Pi has a back power connection somehow through its full USB port :o Avoid this as much as possible and power on the Pi first and then the battery pack on the Dagu mini driver&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The Sony portable charger is pretty nice and the power on/off button actually came in handy though I generally detested it otherwise. This helped in turning off the Pi (CP-F10 L is the model name if you want)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>There is a nice voltage monitor on the Dagu on analog pin 7. This helps in keeping track of the battery levels and can be used to shutdown the car when needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Servos get driven by the USB power as well but motors require battery power for sure&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>This mod will bypass the Email app from becoming device admin for your phone and prevent it from setting up any security restrictions on your device including pin/password/remote wipe, etc. There are a couple other such mods but they don&amp;rsquo;t work at all or don&amp;rsquo;t work for Nexus 4 and/or Android 4.3&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instructions for users&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Remove your existing email account from phone and reboot&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Install Xposed installer (from link above)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Install this mod (Download apk from &lt;a href="https://github.com/shantanugoel/ExchangeBypassXposed/blob/master/ExchangeBypassForXposed/ExchangeBypassForXposed.apk">here&lt;/a> )&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enable the mod in xposed (Preferences for other devices/versions coming Soon)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reboot&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add your email account again. This time, it will ask you that the email
might require security restrictions, say yes to it but it will never actually set the restrictions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Done. :)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Instructions for developers&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Read the xda link at the top of this readme and go through basics of xposed development&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Install xposed as an android sdk addon on your system&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Clone this git repo&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Import in Android Studio&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make changes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Build :)&lt;/li>

Samsung TVs, which are DLNA enabled, also include a hidden service called &amp;ldquo;Message Box&amp;rdquo; which can display different information on the TV natively irrespective of which display mode/input mode you are in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had come across this while reverse engineering the DLNA protocol extensions that Samsung had built in their TVs to get subtitles working over DLNA but didn&amp;rsquo;t put much thought into it. Fueled by the new Raspberry Pi I recently acquired (more on this later below), I set out to find out the details of this service and exploit it for my need and a few hours later, samsung-messagebox was born :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can get it from here: &lt;a href="https://github.com/shantanugoel/samsung-messagebox">https://github.com/shantanugoel/samsung-messagebox&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Usage:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> usage: samsung-msgbox.py -i IP -m MSG [-p PORT] [-t TIME] [-r RECEIVER]

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Send an arbitrary text message to Samsung TVs which is displayed onscreen.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Developed by Shantanu Goel (http://tech.shantanugoel.com/) version 1.0
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Arguments:
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> -i IP, --ip IP Required. IP Address of the TV
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> -m MSG, --msg MSG Required. Message body text to be sent to TV
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> -p PORT, --port PORT Optional. Port on which message should be sent
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> -t TIME, --time TIME Optional. Receive date and time in epoch/unix format
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> -r RECEIVER, --receiver RECEIVER
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Optional. Receiver Name
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> -x RECEIVER_NO, --receiverno RECEIVER_NO
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Optional. Receiver Number
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> -s SENDER, --sender SENDER
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Optional. Sender Name
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> -y SENDER_NO, --senderno SENDER_NO
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Optional. Sender Number
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> -h, --help
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve tested it currently with my 2010 C Series TV. Hopefully, it should work with any TV that has this service. If you face any problems then let me know and I can try to add support for your TV.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Raspberry PI:&lt;/strong> So, where does raspberry pi figure in all this? Well, I wanted to display my incoming call/text alerts on my TV. So, I made a small webserver in python that I run on my raspberry pi, listening for some special parameters. Whenever I get a call or SMS, I created a tasker profile to call this server with the call/sms parameters and the server in turn calls the above samsung-messagebox.py script to display the alerts. I&amp;rsquo;m also planning to integrate it with a dropbox based service to put it to more uses. Let me know if you have any ideas in mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some pics of this working:&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s claim to fame being an awesome virtual surround sound headset which also does the double duty of providing game audio as well as voice chat over the same headset. I preferred this over the Sony PS3 Elite headset as the PX5 is more generic and can work across multiple devices since it uses the regular bluetooth for A2DP and voice chat and the wireless transmitter has standard optical/RCA inputs and outputs.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>So I got this beautiful piece of headset a few days ago, called the EarForce PX5 by TurtleBeach.

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>However, there was one issue. Out of the box, the headset produced serious amount of clicks and pops and other static noises. This is because the wireless transmission for this headset is done over 2.4 GHz band which competes with the various wireless devices that I have around the house. Trying various tools like inSSIDer proved useless as the PX5 isn&amp;rsquo;t a WLAN/802.11 connection evne though it uses the same band. Finally after lot of trial and error, I figured out that doing the following things reduced the noise down to a bare minimum (in fact zero):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Use Channel 9 on the wi-fi router for 2.4GHz band with band width being 20MHz&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Keep the transmitter away from PS3&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Keep the transmitter away from the TV (It&amp;rsquo;s surprising how much the EMI emitting from those huge LCDs can affect wireless performance.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now, it&amp;rsquo;s working awesomely and I just had a decent run of the missing link DLC of Deus Ex HR :)&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Fixing the DS3/Sixaxis Controller Not Working in PSN Store Issue</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2013/01/13/fixing-the-ds3sixaxis-controller-not-working-in-psn-store-issue/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jan 2013 19:55:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2013/01/13/fixing-the-ds3sixaxis-controller-not-working-in-psn-store-issue/</guid><description>&lt;p>So, my wife got me a new slim PS3 today to replace my old YLOD&amp;rsquo;ed phat (Yes, Awesome wife I know. And slim PS3 cuz I hate the looks of the new superslim). But, I digress. The issue at hand is that everything worked fine when I unwrapped it, hooked it up to the power and TV and switched it on. However, once I started the PSN store (or what is now called Sony Entertainment Network Store), nothing worked. I got the main screen/content of the store displayed but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t move around in the store. None of the buttons on the DS3 worked. I hooked up my older sixaxis and still the same. The only thing I could do was to hit the PS button which would bring up a menu from where I could quit the store app and then again everything worked fine once I was out onto XMB or in any game or for any other feature not related to the store.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>So, my wife got me a new slim PS3 today to replace my old YLOD&amp;rsquo;ed phat (Yes, Awesome wife I know.

&lt;p>Using different controllers made sure that it was not a controller issue. I suspected that it could be a bad coding issue on Sony&amp;rsquo;s part where the store is trying to communicate over some ports and the thread blocks on not being able to (since I had the router firewall on and UPnP disabled) making it look like the controller isn&amp;rsquo;t working. So, I turned on UPnP and rebooted the router but still the same issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, ultimately I hit upon the solution by mistake. I kept a button pressed on the controller while the PSN store was starting up and there it was. I could now move around and use the store without any issues. So, that&amp;rsquo;s the solution folks. Just keep a button pressed before starting the store app and keep it pressed till the main screen is fully loaded. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how or why this fixes the problem and I&amp;rsquo;m going to drop a mail to the Sony customer care after writing this blog post. I hope they fix this in the next update.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Chrome Script/Extension installation error: Could not read source file</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2011/09/19/chrome-scriptextension-installation-error-could-not-read-source-file/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2011 16:58:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2011/09/19/chrome-scriptextension-installation-error-could-not-read-source-file/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a solution to the issue that I faced today while installing a javascript file from userscripts.org as an extension into google chrome (Yes, Chrome supports installing greasemonkey javascripts as extensions).

I tried all possible means, like putting it on a different server, installing from local disk, changing versions, deleting all cache, etc but still the issue persisted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally looking into the source code of the chromium browser svn repository, I got a clue. What google chrome does when you install a script as installation is that it first downloads the script, then it calls a function ConvertUserScriptToExtension to convert the script into a google chrome compatible script and then installs it. Now, since I had already installed this script once, I found that the script was already existing in my downloads directory, so while downloading chrome renames it to &lt;code>&amp;lt;file&amp;gt;(1).js&lt;/code> (i.e., appends a number to it to distinguish from the original file). But it seems like that the path sent to the conversion function still uses the original name/path and it somehow finds that the older file is not the downloaded one but also doesn&amp;rsquo;t know which is the current downloaded one and hence fails with an error &amp;ldquo;Could not read source file&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Solution: Pretty simple. Just delete the original file present in your download directory and then try installing the script and it will install fine :)&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Use Encrypted Google Search As Default in Chrome</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2011/05/12/use-encrypted-google-search-as-default-in-chrome/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2011 04:26:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2011/05/12/use-encrypted-google-search-as-default-in-chrome/</guid><description>&lt;p>Google just launched an &lt;a href="https://encrypted.google.com/">encrypted search portal&lt;/a> which is a Godsend for people on public networks since there is a lot that can be gleaned from your search queries.

What is even more weird is that when you search for the name of the package that the given command seems to install cannot be found using apt-cache search. e.g. You will see this used most often when someone tells you how to install LAMP server setup (Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP) by using the command &amp;ldquo;sudo apt-get install lamp-server^&amp;rdquo;. If you miss the caret at the end or try to search for lamp-server, it just doesn&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>If you have come across a tutorial or just someone on a forum who tells you to install something in Debian/Ubuntu that involves using apt-get, it is ok for you but when they tell you that you need to use a caret symbol (^) at the end, that&amp;rsquo;s where you become curious.

If you miss the caret at the end or try to search for lamp-server, it just doesn&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, the answer is that the caret symbol is a short form for performing a task that otherwise the program &amp;ldquo;tasksel&amp;rdquo; would have done with the given package name. tasksel is a program to ease the installation of commonly used things that go together for a particular use. e.g. In the above instance of LAMP, the four packages and their dependencies are always used together, so tasksel provides a sort of a meta-package or meta-task that can be run by the user with a single command and then tasksel will take it upon itself to install all of them and set them up correctly for your use. Now, apt-get provides a way to perform that same task by itself without you having to install tasksel first and all you have to do is to give that same package name to apt-get but just append a caret at the end to tell apt-get that it is a tasksel package/task identifier and not a regular package name in debian/ubuntu repositories.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hope that clears things up :)&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Setup Call Recording With Android App Tasker On Nexus One</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/09/24/setup-call-recording-android-app-tasker-nexus-one/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Sep 2010 10:01:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/09/24/setup-call-recording-android-app-tasker-nexus-one/</guid><description>&lt;p>I wanted to record calls on my Android phone (Nexus one).

And given that I recently bought &lt;a href="http://tasker.dinglisch.net/">Tasker&lt;/a>, android’s very own swiss knife, I thought I should give it a run. After just an hour I was able to create my very own call recorder (some time went into trial and error with things as this was my first major task with tasker and also some things didn’t work with nexus one, which I will note below). I’ll outline the process to set it up here in as much detail as possible and will also provide the profiles. Please note that I made this setup for nexus one but it should work on pretty much any android phone and, in fact, it might work even better on your phone by making a few tweaks that I will outline as Nexus one doesn’t allow jacking into the call streams directly but your phone might.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, let’s begin. My visioned scenario is like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>When you start a call (incoming or outgoing), i.e., when both the parties have picked up the phone, a notification should appear in the status bar.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Clicking on this notification should start recording the call. It should also give way to another notification now.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>This new notification should stop the call recording when clicked.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If you don’t stop the call recording, the recording should automatically stop when the call ends.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>To achieve the steps mentioned above, you will have to create “4” profiles in tasker. The xml files for these profiles are provided in a zip at the end of this article that you can download and import into tasker directly. If you want to understand more about whats going on, here are the details of each profile so that you can understand and modify them according to your needs. These profiles are:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Profile 1. Call Started&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tasker description:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Profile: Call started
Event: Phone Offhook
Enter: 11
Execute, Abort New Task
A0: Variable Clear [ Name:%RECORDING ]
A1: Notify [ Title:Record Call Text: Icon: Number: Permanent: ]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Notes:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>None&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Profile 2. Record Call&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tasker description:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Profile: Record call
Event: Notification Click
Enter: Record Call
Execute, Abort New Task
A0: Notify Cancel [ Title:Record Call Warn Not Exist: ]
A1: Variable Set [ Name:%RECORDING To:1 Do Maths: Append: ]
A2: In-Call Volume [ Level:5 Display: Sound: ]
A3: Speakerphone [ Set:On ]
A4: Flash [ Text:Started Recording Long: ]
A5: Notify [ Title:Stop Record Call Text: Icon: Number: Permanent: ]
A6: Record Audio [ File:shantz/call-%CNUM-%CDATE-%CTIME Source:Microphone MaxSize: ]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Notes: **&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note the steps A2, A3 and A6. Basically Nexus one has a limitation that you cannot record directly from the call streams. So, I’m doing the recording from the microphone and this works best if the phone is in speakerphone mode. So, I’m turning up the call volume and setting speakerphone mode in A2 and A3 respectively. You can try tweaking these 2 steps (having different call volumes and not engaging speakerphone mode and you might have passable results without doing these as well). Also, try using “Call”, “Incoming Call”, “Outgoing Call” etc as sources in step A6 instead of microphone to check if your phone supports direct call stream recording. If it does, then you will have excellent recording quality and you can also remove steps A2 and A3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Profile 3. Stop Record Call&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tasker description:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Profile: Stop record call
Event: Notification Click
Enter: Stop Record Call
Execute, Abort New Task
A0: Record Audio Stop [ ]
A1: Notify Cancel [ Title:Record Call Warn Not Exist: ]
A2: Notify Cancel [ Title:Stop Record Call Warn Not Exist: ]
A3: Flash [ Text:Stopped Recording Long: ]
A4: Variable Clear [ Name:%RECORDING ]
A5: Speakerphone [ Set:Off ]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Notes: **&lt;/p>
&lt;p>None&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Profile 4. Call Complete&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tasker description:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Profile: Call complete
Event: Phone Idle
Enter: Stop Record Call
Execute, Abort New Task
A0: Record Audio Stop [ ]
A1: Notify Cancel [ Title:Record Call Warn Not Exist: ]
A2: Notify Cancel [ Title:Stop Record Call Warn Not Exist: ]
A3: Flash [ Text:Stopped Recording Long: ]
A4: Variable Clear [ Name:%RECORDING ]
A5: Speakerphone [ Set:Off ]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Notes: **&lt;/p>
&lt;p>None&lt;/p>

This happens even if they support all android versions and have published their apps for all countries, so that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the issue. I came across this as well when few people mentioned that they couldn&amp;rsquo;t find my app Wi-Fi Keep Alive in the X10 mini marketplace. On some digging into the android docs and the X10 mini specs, I found the issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem is that the X10 mini has a very small screen with only a QVGA resolution. This screen size/resolution wasn&amp;rsquo;t supported by Android until recently and the Android system might not be able to scale resources and layouts designed for other screen sizes well enough to suit the X10 mini. Hence, the Android system designers have chosen that any app which does not declare explicit support for small screens (i.e., the app dev has tested his app on small screens and made any changes, if needed, and then declared that everything works fine in the Android Manifest) then it is considered not compatible by default and hence, the Android marketplace will filter your app out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, this is a big loss. A lot of X10 minis were sold and there are lot of new low-tier and cheap Android smartphones coming out with this resolution, so it is a significant market share that you can&amp;rsquo;t afford to lose. The solution is simple. If the app does indeed work fine on small screens (or you have fixed it to work), then all you got to do is add the below mentioned line in your AndroidManifest.xml:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>&amp;lt;supports-screens android:smallScreens=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s it. Your app should now show up fine in all screen sizes markets. Note that for all other screen sizes and resolutions, Android considers the default support as true and your app will show in those markets even if you don&amp;rsquo;t make any explicit declarations for them. You can read more about this here: &lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html">Supporting Multiple Screens in Android&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Update: **&lt;a href="http://www.blundell-apps.com/">Blundell&lt;/a> pointed out in the comments that &lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html%23defaults">Android documentation&lt;/a> says&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>If android:minSdkVersion or android:targetSdkVersion is &amp;ldquo;4&amp;rdquo; (Android 1.6) or higher, the default value for everything is true. If your application requires Android 1.6 features, but does not support these densities and/or screen sizes, you need to set the appropriate attributes to false.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This should mean that small screens should be set as supported by default if you have your minSdk &lt;strong>or&lt;/strong> targetSdk   set to anything above or equal to 4. However, in my case, my apps had minSdk as 3 but targetSdk as 7 or 8 but still they didn&amp;rsquo;t show up in X10 mini marketplace till I added the smallScreens support to true in my manifest file. If anyone has any ideas about as to why it was like this, please let me know.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>SSH Tunneling On Android</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/08/02/ssh-tunneling-android/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2010 10:53:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/08/02/ssh-tunneling-android/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you want to have a secure browsing environment or just want to access your home network securely without exposing extra services to the internet and without the mess that comes with setting up and maintaining a VPN server, ssh tunneling is your rescuer.

In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you how to setup an ssh tunnel to your home network easily. Also look for some bonus tips at the end ;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This article assumes that you have already installed and setup a ssh server (you can probably use openssh). Also, it assumes that the ssh server is accessible from the internet (i.e. you have appropriately forwarded the port on which ssh server is running). I&amp;rsquo;d also recommend that if you do not have a static IP for your home network, then sign up for a dynamic DNS service (I use dyndns.org) so that you can access your home network easily by using a domain name (e.g. myserver.dyndns.org) from outside.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, here is a step by step guide on what to do on your Android Phone (I&amp;rsquo;m doing this on a Nexus one but should be same for you as well):&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Install an app called &amp;ldquo;connectbot&amp;rdquo; from the android marketplace. It is a FREE ssh client for android.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Open it and add the IP (or dynamic domain name as suggested above) and the port on which ssh server is running to the bottom and connect.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/ssh-tunnel-1-thumb.png" alt="Android SSH Tunnel 1">&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>Once connected, press the menu button and select the icon which says &amp;ldquo;Port Forwards&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/ssh-tunnel-2-thumb.png" alt="Android SSH Tunnel 2">&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>On this screen you can configure the ports to be used for tunneling. As you can see I already have my firefly server port configured for music streaming over itunes&amp;rsquo; DAAP protocol. Now, you can press &amp;ldquo;menu&amp;rdquo; button and click on &amp;ldquo;Add ports&amp;rdquo; and go to step 5.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/ssh-tunnel-3-thumb.png" alt="Android SSH Tunnel 3">&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="5">
&lt;li>You will see the dialog box as shown below. Here you can configure mainly two types of ports.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/ssh-tunnel-4-thumb.png" alt="Android SSH Tunnel 4">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>5a) First is for services that you want to access already running on your home network. e.g. in my case, I have a firefly media server (mt-daapd) running on a port &amp;ldquo;12345&amp;rdquo; and I want to access this just like I was on LAN over my home wi-fi. In such a case, select &amp;ldquo;type&amp;rdquo; as &amp;ldquo;Local&amp;rdquo;, source port as , say &amp;ldquo;56000&amp;rdquo; and destination as &amp;ldquo;ip:port&amp;rdquo; where ip is the your home local area IP of the machine on which the server is running (My server runs on router itself, which has IP 192.168.1.1) and the port is the actual port on which server is running (e.g. 12345 as we mentioned above). After doing this, just open the respective client app on your phone which wants to connect to this server and enter &amp;ldquo;127.0.0.1&amp;rdquo; as the ip and &amp;ldquo;56000&amp;rdquo; as the port to connect to and it will connect to server as if you were on your home network even over 3G or your office wi-fi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>5b) Secondly, you can use this tunnel to route all traffic to internet through home connection. For this, choose the type as &amp;ldquo;dynamic&amp;rdquo; and source port as, say, &amp;quot; 56001&amp;quot;. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to select a destination port here because any traffic that comes over this tunnel will be routed back to the internet using the destination ip and port as desired, e.g., specified in a browser&amp;rsquo;s address bar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Bonus: **As I promised above, here is the bonus. For media streaming, you can use mt-daapd or firefly server on your home network, especially on a router like asus wl-500 or any other hackable router with custom firmware. For more info about how to set it up, you can check these posts:&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/2009/07/03/compiling-latest-firefly-mt-daapd-asus-wl-500w.html"> Latest Firefly server for your router&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/2010/07/26/firefly-sqlite-error-unable-to-open-database-file-solution.html">firefly sqlite error solution&lt;/a>.   For android side things, install the &amp;ldquo;DAAP Client&amp;rdquo; app from the market place and click on &amp;ldquo;Add server&amp;rdquo; option and follow step 4a as mentioned above. And there it is, your own music streaming service anywhere in the world, over edge/3G or any other network :)&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Firefly / sqlite error "unable to open database file" Solution</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/07/26/firefly-sqlite-error-unable-to-open-database-file-solution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jul 2010 18:11:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/07/26/firefly-sqlite-error-unable-to-open-database-file-solution/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently I came across a weird error while trying to run firefly itunes server (mt-daapd) on my router (Asus wl-500w). It had something to do with sqlite and gave a vague message &amp;ldquo;Unable to open database file&amp;rdquo;. After going bonkers for a short time, I solved it and this is how.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of my hard disks crashed recently and unfortunately it was the one I had connected to my router to serve media to me all over the house (through PS3/laptop) or when I travel (through laptop/phone). I had all the data backed up but somehow didn&amp;rsquo;t preserve the firefly server. I rebuilt the server from source using my &lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/2009/07/03/compiling-latest-firefly-mt-daapd-asus-wl-500w.html">own guide&lt;/a> (Thank God I did it. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been able to preserve my sanity finding all that out the hard way again.). But after doing all the installation and reconfiguration, it gave me a weird error &amp;ldquo;unable to open database file&amp;rdquo; every time and exited. I checked the permissions on the songs3.db file (in /opt/var/cache/mt-daapd for me) and made it writable by all but the issue persisted. I changed its ownership to the user under which firefly was running but the issue was still there. Finally I found that the server (or maybe its an sqlite thing) was trying to create a temp file in the cache directory for the transactions and since the user with which it was started, didn&amp;rsquo;t own the directory it wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to create the file in it.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>Recently I came across a weird error while trying to run firefly itunes server (mt-daapd) on my router (Asus wl-500w).

I am a happy man now since I own a new android phone since last time and now able to stream all my music to my phone through itunes (daap protocol) server over an ssh tunnel :)&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Cannot Change Channel Problem With Asus WL-500W</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/07/13/cannot-change-channel-problem-with-asus-wl-500w/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2010 12:16:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/07/13/cannot-change-channel-problem-with-asus-wl-500w/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently I found an issue with my asus wl-500w wi-fi router that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to change the channel on which it was transmitting.

&lt;p>But by sheer chance, I stumbled upon the solution finally by trial and error. The solution is that you should set the &amp;ldquo;Bandwidth&amp;rdquo; to 20 MHz in wi-fi configuration if you are using 802.11 G. If you set it to 40 MHz then it gets stuck somehow but as soon as I changed it to 20 MHz, I was able to see the channel change immediately after reboot. Here is the screenshot of the page where you can find this setting.&lt;/p>

Here is how:&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>Skype on linux works great but the problem that I faced was that it does not handle the buttons on the bluetooth headsets. My wife uses skype to call into her work related conference calls and was pretty frustrated that she had to keep sitting in front of my laptop (her laptop didn&amp;rsquo;t allow to install skype) just to switch mute on and off. So, I whipped up this little trick to do so. Here is how:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>First I looked at the skype API (pretty simple, based on dbus). Also found a sample script somewhere that allowed to answer and hang up calls through skype API.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Modified the script to switch the mute on and off instead of answering/hanging up. Script can be downloaded at the end of this article. You can also modify it to take some other action that you want.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Install &amp;ldquo;blueman&amp;rdquo;. If you are using Ubuntu, just type &amp;ldquo;sudo apt-get install blueman&amp;rdquo; in shell.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Once blueman is installed and you have done your headset pairing etc, right click on the blueman icon in the system tray and click on &amp;ldquo;Local Services&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>In local services, click on headset tab and you can see a input box where you can give the path of a program/script which will be run whenever the &amp;ldquo;answer button&amp;rdquo; on the headset is pressed. This is important to note that blueman only supports the answer button and nothing else and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the inclination to develop a full-fledged AVRCP compliant program to capture other buttons as all I was interested in mute functionality. You can see the screenshot of this below:&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/blueman-skype-bluetooth-mute-button.png">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/blueman-skype-bluetooth-mute-button-thumb.png" alt="Skype Headset Button Settings for Blueman">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="6">
&lt;li>Make sure that you give the path where you saved the script that you downloaded in step 4 and you are all set now. Make a call and click on the answer button of your headset to see the magic happen :P&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Let me know if you have your own hacks like this or know of a way to have a full fledged capturing of all headset buttons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Sorry I lost the file somewhere over the years during a server move and it&amp;rsquo;s no longer available&lt;/em>&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Integrate JDownloader with Flashgot</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/04/14/jdownloader-flashgot-integrate/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Apr 2010 16:21:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/04/14/jdownloader-flashgot-integrate/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is just a short post to to document how I got JDownloader to integrate with Flashgot. JDownloader doesn&amp;rsquo;t have an installer but a zip file that you just download and extract somewhere on your PC and start using it. Somehow, the Flashgot extension of Firefox is not able to detect it automatically and I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what parameters to use to add it manually to its list. Latest versions of JDownloader ask you whether you want to install Flashgot or not. I didn&amp;rsquo;t install it because I already had Flashgot. Turns out that this is the missing step. You should allow JDownloader to install Flashgot in your browser, even if it is already installed(If you have already run JDownloader once and didn&amp;rsquo;t say yes to installing flashgot, then you can do it by going to Settings-&amp;gt;Plugins 7 Addons-&amp;gt;Extensions-&amp;gt;Flashgot for Firefox in JDownloader and clicking Install). And then, you will see that the JDownloader option is not grayed out anymore. If you see the version of Flashgot that JDownloader is installs is older than the official version, don&amp;rsquo;t fret. Now, you can re-update the flashgot addon (Tools-&amp;gt;Addons-&amp;gt;Find Updates in firefox) and the JDownloader integration will still stay intact. Hope that helps someone :)&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>This is just a short post to to document how I got JDownloader to integrate with Flashgot.

Latest versions of JDownloader ask you whether you want to install Flashgot or not. I didn&amp;rsquo;t install it because I already had Flashgot. Turns out that this is the missing step. You should allow JDownloader to install Flashgot in your browser, even if it is already installed(If you have already run JDownloader once and didn&amp;rsquo;t say yes to installing flashgot, then you can do it by going to Settings-&amp;gt;Plugins 7 Addons-&amp;gt;Extensions-&amp;gt;Flashgot for Firefox in JDownloader and clicking Install). And then, you will see that the JDownloader option is not grayed out anymore. If you see the version of Flashgot that JDownloader is installs is older than the official version, don&amp;rsquo;t fret. Now, you can re-update the flashgot addon (Tools-&amp;gt;Addons-&amp;gt;Find Updates in firefox) and the JDownloader integration will still stay intact. Hope that helps someone :)&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Automatic Login For Beam Cable</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/04/14/beam-cable-automatic-login/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Apr 2010 04:33:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/04/14/beam-cable-automatic-login/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>This article will tell you a simple way to login automatically to beam cable (Beam-Telecom) internet connection instead of using the web login manually.&lt;/strong> Not only that, I’ll also tell you how to do this auto-login through your router if you have one with a custom linux firmware. I took a beam cable connection a few days ago. The price is excellent and speeds are good but the only thing that bothered me was the web based login. You need to open up a browser and login through their online portal before you can access the internet. Now, if you don’t log off, then the login may persist even across PC/router reboots but many times it doesn’t. But in these times, it becomes a pain in the wrong place when I am just looking to play online on my PS3 or one of my various net-capable devices, scattered around the house, are trying to pull data and this forces me to open up my laptop just to login. Even for people who use the internet only on their PC, they might not be using the browser all the time and find it a hassle, minor one but still a hassle, to open a browser and login. Hence, I set out to find a way to do this automatically. (BTW, I’ll also be listing out how I came onto the solution in case you are in interested.

Hence, I set out to find a way to do this automatically. (BTW, I’ll also be listing out how I came onto the solution in case you are in interested. If you are not, feel free to skip some paragraphs below to move to the solution)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First off, I came to know that Beam cable supports PPPoE logins, but for the life of me, I (and any of my friends) couldn’t get it working. So, I thought of an alternative approach. Since, this was just a login through a web page, there was a good chance that I could automate it through perl/wget/curl etc. I immediately opened up their portal and took a look at the source code in the hopes of finding out the login form, which I could use to find the POST data that they want and submit it through wget. But what I found was that they are using javascript to do the login process, so no direct way of finding this out. And on top of that, the functions are not embedded in the page but loaded through an external script.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hmm, a setback but a minor one. Javascript is still a client-side executed environment so all hope wasn’t lost. I could have waded through the browser cache to find the js files loaded by the portal and went through the functions to reconstruct the data that I need but I chose an easier way. There is this excellent addon for firefox called “Live Headers”. It shows you all the transactions happening between your browser and the server. So, I just fired it up, filled in my login details in the portal and hit “Login”. On seeing the live headers log, I found out the exact url as well as the POST data that they were sending to do the actual login and from there it was a piece of cake. With “wget”, it is as simple as executing&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>wget &amp;lt;url&amp;gt; --post-data=&amp;lt;data&amp;gt;&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, by substituting the information that I got, this is the command that you need to execute on your PC (For linux/mac it is already installed generally and for windows, you will need to download from &lt;a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm">here&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>wget http://123.176.37.2/newportal/Ajax.php --post-data=&amp;#34;function=ExecuteLogin&amp;amp;user=YOURBEAMUSERNAME&amp;amp;pwd=YOURBEAMPASSWORD&amp;amp;remember=false&amp;amp;timestamp=1271186686298&amp;#34;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Please remember to replace YOURBEAMUSERNAME and YOURBEAMPASSWORD with your actual username and password respectively. Also, please note that the above command is all one single line (it might appear in multiple lines in your browser).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, everytime you need to login just run this command. Now, how to do this automatically? For linux, just put it inside a shell script for linux and set it to run automatically on bootup. For windows, paste the command in a text file, and save it as beam_login.bat and put it in your start up folder so that it runs everytime on boot. (You might want to put some delays in there as it might take some time to get connected to the network or you can query the network interface to run it when the network is up. Let me know if you want to know how to do this for your platform and I can help you).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, this is for the PC, now how about if I need to use non-browser capable devices. This is easy if you have a router with a custom linux firmware (because they generally have wget installed or allow you to install it). I have an Asus wl-500w with oleg’s custom firmware installed and it was a piece of cake with it. I just created the following shell script&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">#!/bin/sh

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">then&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>rm Ajax.php
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">fi&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">#Limit the number of retries to prevent the router from going into continuous loop &lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>num_retries&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">10&lt;/span>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">do&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>wget http://123.176.37.2/newportal/Ajax.php --post-data&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;function=ExecuteLogin&amp;amp;user=YOURBEAMUSERNAME&amp;amp;pwd=YOURBEAMPASSWORD&amp;amp;remember=false&amp;amp;timestamp=1271186686298&amp;#34;&lt;/span>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">then&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>rm Ajax.php
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>break
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">else&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sleep 2s

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">fi&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">done&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Then I set it to run on boot and voila!! A tip for other users of any of the asus routers with oleg’s firmware (like wl-500g, wl-520gu, wl-500gp etc). The firmware has some scripts in the /local/sbin folder that are run at various times. I suggest you put the above code inside the &lt;strong>post-firewall&lt;/strong> script. (Do not forget to run “flashfs save &amp;amp;&amp;amp; flasfs commit &amp;amp;&amp;amp; flashfs enable” to save your changes). Now, every time my router reboots, it automatically logs in to the connection :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hope I have been clear in the isntructions. If you are unclear about anything or need any help in implementing it for your specific platform, do let me know.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Continuous Monitoring With Tail Fails</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/12/23/continuous-monitor-tail-fails/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Dec 2009 18:10:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/12/23/continuous-monitor-tail-fails/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you can&amp;rsquo;t get tail command to continuously monitor a file, then read on.

I had used our trusty old &amp;ldquo;tail&amp;rdquo; command for this but while testing by manually putting in some data into the file, it was failing but curiously it was working fine when used in actual scenario. Befuddled, I did a simple test. I created a simple text file &amp;ldquo;a.txt&amp;rdquo; with a few lines of data and then ran the following command.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>tail -f a.txt&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It showed the last few lines of the file and kept waiting. So far so good. Then I opened the file in vim editor, wrote a few more lines, saved the file and then waited but nothing in the window that was running the tail command. Thinking that the data might be buffered and not flushed to the disc yet, I ran the sync command but still nothing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I got a hint that when I used the &amp;ldquo;-F&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;&amp;ndash;follow=name&amp;rdquo; option instead of &amp;ldquo;-f&amp;rdquo;, the tail command was able to detect the change just fine, the only problem being that in this mode, it prints the last few lines again, not just the newly added line. The main difference in these new options is that tail command tracks the file for changes by its name and not by the file descriptor, and then it dawned on me. The problem is not in the tail command but my testing method itself. When I save the file opened in vim, it creates a new file with a new inode while the one opened by tail is still the old one (which is now a temporary file which has actually been deleted). When I quit tail, then the kernel deletes the file automatically. This is also confirmed by running &amp;ldquo;lsof | grep a.txt&amp;rdquo; (lsof lists the open files and then we find the ones related to a.txt). The output shown is;&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>tail 11966 shantanu 3r REG 8,6 8 224954 /home/shantanu/dev/perl/plot/a.txt~ (deleted)

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>which shows what we had discussed above. This gets worked around when I use the -F option because then tail periodically reopens the file by name and reads it again, thus bypassing the above issue. Then I simply tried running tail again on the same file and doing something like &amp;ldquo;echo abc &amp;raquo; a.txt&amp;rdquo; and I could see the behaviour as expected with tail immediately detecting the change and displaying it in its window. Hope this helps if you have been pulling out your hair thinking you have gone crazy as your favourite little tool that you have been using for so many years has suddenly stopped working and no one else apart from you is even complaining :P&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>grub and knetworkmanager problems in Kubuntu Karmic</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/11/08/grub-knetworkmanager-kubuntu-karmic/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Nov 2009 12:08:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/11/08/grub-knetworkmanager-kubuntu-karmic/</guid><description>&lt;p>I generally move from &lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/2008/05/21/ubuntu-what-exactly-does-lts-mean.html">LTS&lt;/a> to LTS releases of Ubuntu but reluctantly had to update my system to Karmic when my old HDD gave in.

Here are the 2 main issues that I faced along with their solutions, in the hope that if someone else runs into same issues does not have to waste time (and hair) on it :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>1. Bootloader Issue:&lt;/strong> I dual boot my system along with Win XP (Needed for some office work) and generally install the bootloader onto a separate boot partition instead of overwriting the MBR. But this time when I did the same, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t boot (not even the grub menu). When I did this, the very helpful message that I got on restarting after installing kubuntu was “Error loading operating system”. I could still go back to my good windows install by setting the boot flag onto its partition. I mucked around with it a lot, trying to install grub2 again and found that actually it fails when I try to do the above (install on a partition). I also tried copying the boot sector from my /boot partition to C: and use ntldr to boot into linux but that also didn’t work. This lead me to believe that the same thing happened during my main installation and the installer failed to tell me anything about it. I tried then to install it on MBR but that also mucked up things and I couldn’t even get the error message, a cursor just kept blinking. Finally, the solution. I had to install kubuntu again and this time selected to overwrite MBR (this is default, BTW).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2. Wi-Fi Connection Issue:&lt;/strong> Second immediate issue was with knetworkmanager. It failed to start my wi-fi module (even after installing restricted drivers). I disabled and enabled wi-fi, so that brought some life to it (wi-fi led started glowing) but it still couldn’t scan for any access points. I could do the scan through command line and see my AP but my AP is WPA2 secured and I didn’t want to mess around with wpa-supplicant stuff. Solution: Installed Wicd. And it worked automagically.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hope this helps someone else who faces the same issue. Looks like my idea of moving to kubuntu wasn’t a good one (especially because I had 2 lockups during the 1 hour I used it for in the wee hours of this morning). I’ll probably give it another week or so before taking the decision whether to move back to ubuntu or not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One good thing to take away from this though: For the first time I could really appreciate the live CD installer that these linux distros give. As I could search about the various issues I had without having a second computer. But then again, it’s not that good as well because it means that so far I never had any installation issues at all…&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Making Frets On Fire Work With Pulse Aludio - pasuspender</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/08/23/make-frets-on-fire-work-pulse-audio-pasuspender/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Aug 2009 18:18:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/08/23/make-frets-on-fire-work-pulse-audio-pasuspender/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently got hold of a Guitar Hero controller for my PS3 but the game still had some time to come so I tried it out on my laptop with Frets on Fire (rather FoFix).

&lt;p>Kind of disappointed, I had a hunch which solved it for me though today :). When I tried to read the output voltage from the output ports on the UPS, it showed me 225–230V when main supply was on. As soon as it was switched off, the output dropped to around 160V. On connecting the PS3, it went up a bit (to around 180V). Now, the load should not have been an issue because a PS3 requires 180–350W I think, which can easily be given by even a 500VA UPS. So far, all suggestions given to me were to remove everything else from the UPS except the PS3, but that was actually my setup in the very first place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The weird idea that I had was that the problem is, in fact, that the PS3 is not enough load for it. Call me crazy but as soon as I connected my TV also to the UPS, it started working just fine and dandy. No trip ups now, and I can even cold-boot my PS3 and TV from the UPS backup alone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, I ain’t the sharpest tool in the shed when it comes to electrical stuff (in fact this was one of my most dreaded subjects during my graduation). So, if anyone can give me a sound reasoning behind what I just saw would be very much appreciated. Or is this a real fault with the unit that I got, or maybe it is a defect in all the Microtek UPS’s? Anyways, I ain’t complaining till it’s working for me :) and if you are seeing the same issues you could try the same as well.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>TIP: Perforce - Sync Files In A Label Without Deleting Previous Files</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/03/27/p4perforce-sync-files-label-without-deleting-previous/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Mar 2009 14:00:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/03/27/p4perforce-sync-files-label-without-deleting-previous/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you have used perforce, you&amp;rsquo;d have definitely come across a situation where you wanted to sync files belonging to two different labels, but as soon as you sync the second label, the files from the first label get deleted.

&lt;p>Well, I have an excellent wi-fi router (Asus WL-500W) that does have ssh (which I have configured to listen on, say, port XXXX). Now all I do is:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Disable telnet access to modem from WAN but enable from LAN.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Forward this particular port XXXX in modem&amp;rsquo;s configuration to the router&amp;rsquo;s IP.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Optional: Register for a dynamic dns account (e.g. dyndns.org) and update the same in modem&amp;rsquo;s config so I can access my modem through a domain name since I have a dynamic IP which changes all the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Now, ssh to my external (WAN) IP from outside (say from work). Since, the port is forwarded to my router, it the router that answers my ssh request.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>After logging in to my router, simply telnet to the modem using its LAN IP and configure away.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Simple, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? I would advise you all to make a similar setup for yourself as well, if possible, rather than taking risks of unsecure access.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>[TIP] Install Twonky on Asus WL-500W with stock firmware</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/02/23/tip-install-twonky-on-asus-wl-500w-with-stock-firmware/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2009 06:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/02/23/tip-install-twonky-on-asus-wl-500w-with-stock-firmware/</guid><description>&lt;p>Asus WL-500W is a greate wi-fi router with lots of features, one of them being able to use it as a media server to serve movies/songs over your network from a hard disk connected directly to it through USB.

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Download Twonky (The MIPS version) and extract/save it to some place on the harddisk attached to your router (e.g. /tmp/harddisk/part0/twonky/ )&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Create a new shell script for starting twonky automatically (Replace the paths according to where you stored the twonky files in step 1). All you need to do is create a text file with following contents and mark it as executable. We&amp;rsquo;ll name it init.sh.&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Copy this script to your harddisk to where you extracted twonky files.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Open up the router&amp;rsquo;s web administration page (most probably at 192.168.1.1), go to the USB section, and put the following line under &amp;ldquo;Initial Script&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

After a quick look I found out the issue. Ubuntu had created another partition with /tmp being its mount point and its maz size was set to 1 MB.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A search told me that this occurs if you happen to run out of disk space on your root partition some time, so Ubuntu automatically limits the size of /tmp to squeeze as much out of the remaining space as it can. Ideally, original behaviour of /tmp should be restored once you recover some space but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen. The solution? Well, it is pretty simple. Just follow these steps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step 1. Open up /etc/mtab in your favourite editor. e.g. gksudo gedit /etc/mtab&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step 2. Look for a line that looks something like below example and delete it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>overflow /tmp tmpfs rw,size=1048576,mode=1777 0 0&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step 3. Save the file and restart your computer. That&amp;rsquo;s it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, this problem might not just be Ubuntu specific though and might happen with other distros as well. So, if you come across such an issue, try out this solution.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>[Ubuntu TIP] Solved: Totem Cannot Detect UPnP Media Server</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/01/31/ubuntu-tip-solved-totem-cannot-detect-upnp-media-server/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2009 17:46:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/01/31/ubuntu-tip-solved-totem-cannot-detect-upnp-media-server/</guid><description>&lt;p>First a bit of background. A UPnP media server can serve your media files (video / audio / pictures) over the network to any compatible player. Some of the most known examples of these media servers are MediaTomb, TVersity, ushare, etc. In linux, few players can play media off these servers natively, but many require a plugin / library called &amp;ldquo;coherence&amp;rdquo;. e.g. the default media players (Totem and RhythmBox) can detect and play media from media servers once you install coherence (&amp;ldquo;sudo apt-get install python-coherence&amp;rdquo;). This works, BUT you will see that many times Totem will stop detecting the server suddenly. It happens to me quite a bit (The server I use is Mediatomb). First I thought that the problem is with Media Tomb, but my PS3 continued to play videos from it over wi-fi without any issues, so that was ruled out.

Send custom automatic replies to different people when they message you and came across a strange bug. It never sent the reply when you received the first message from someone. I was using the &amp;ldquo;ReceivedImMessage&amp;rdquo; signal over d-bus (or &amp;ldquo;received-im-message&amp;rdquo; for the plugin writers). What I found initially looked to be a gross and basic error by pidgin developers, but later found that it is indeed a good design and thought that I&amp;rsquo;ll make a post about it for the benefit of fellow pidgin plugin/app developers.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>Recently I wrote a small autoreply-answering-machine app for pidgin with a simple premise.

What I found initially looked to be a gross and basic error by pidgin developers, but later found that it is indeed a good design and thought that I&amp;rsquo;ll make a post about it for the benefit of fellow pidgin plugin/app developers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a bit of debugging I saw that when I received the ReceivedImMessage signal for the first message, the &amp;ldquo;Conversation ID&amp;rdquo; field is not a valid value but 0. Thereafter, I got the correct value every time. Searching on the google didn&amp;rsquo;t reveal much except a few other people complaining about the same and someone saying that this is a bug because pidgin first sends the signal and then creates the conversation while it should be the other way round.  Fair enough. But then&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I came across a short explanation by a pidgin developer, seanegen, (sorry lost the link somewhere). Basically, the reason behind this is that all the checks (e.g. Blacklists etc) are performed after one gets this signal, and hence they dont create the window otherwise it might be created even if you have blocked the person who is sending you the message. Perfect explanation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, what&amp;rsquo;s the solution. Simple..Use the &amp;ldquo;DisplayedImMessage&amp;rdquo; (or &amp;ldquo;displayed-im-message&amp;rdquo; signal) which is sent, once the conversation has been created. That&amp;rsquo;s it. Hope that this post benefit you.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Dropbox Online Storage Public/Shared Folders: A Word Of Caution</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/09/16/dropbox-online-storage-publicshared-folders-a-word-of-caution/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2008 14:26:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/09/16/dropbox-online-storage-publicshared-folders-a-word-of-caution/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update:&lt;/strong> In a &lt;a href="http://forums.getdropbox.com/topic.php?id=4207">thread about this post at Dropbox forums&lt;/a>, it was brought to my notice that Dropbox has now changed its &lt;a href="https://www.getdropbox.com/terms#terms">terms&lt;/a> to remove the objectionable clause.&lt;/p>

But before we begin, please make sure you have read Part 1 of my post, because here I&amp;rsquo;ll start from the point where we left off in the earlier post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I began thinking on the lines of setting up a ramdisk first (and remapping the browser cache folders to the new path in this ramdisk), so that nothing gets written to the hard disk, ever, even if the browser tries very hard. Best security right? Yes, but it involved a few issues like data is still there until you reboot also a part of your ram is always blocked, etc. So I went with the approach given below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Method: Easier and privacy on-par with Chrome/IE8&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just do the following in addition to the Step 4.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Uncheck &amp;ldquo;Keep my history&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Uncheck &amp;ldquo;Remember what I enter in forms and the search bar&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Uncheck &amp;ldquo;Remember what I&amp;rsquo;ve downloaded&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Choose &amp;ldquo;Keep until I close firefox&amp;rdquo; for cookies&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Press advanced settings in &amp;ldquo;Private Data&amp;rdquo;, select unselect options according to your choice. For max protection, select everything.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Open a new tab, and write &amp;ldquo;about:config&amp;rdquo; (without quotes) in address bar, press enter.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Search for &amp;ldquo;browser.cache.disk.enable&amp;rdquo; and set it to false&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Search for &amp;ldquo;browser.cache.offline.enable&amp;rdquo; and set it to false&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Done. You are secure and remember, this is just a one time setup, you won&amp;rsquo;t have to do this again and again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side Note: Usability is another concern. However, I think that is debatable and varies from user to user highly. The steps lined up in these 2 posts aren&amp;rsquo;t too hard to carry out and take around a minute to do, and is a one time effort. Now, compare this with option where you use google chrome and love its in-built incognito mode but then have to leave all the extensions and greasemonkey scripts of firefox behind which made browsing so much more accessible for you. Another path could be to use both the browsers. Anyways, I&amp;rsquo;ll not go further down this path. This is for you to decide what you feel is more usable for you :) . This is just something to say &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not impossible&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>

You just need to devote less than one minute (yes, you read that right, less than one minute) to set it up. Well, actions are better than words, so here it goes:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step 1.) Run the following command to start the firefox profile manager.(In Linux, press Alt+F2 and in Windows, press Win+R to bring up the run dialogue box)&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>firefox -ProfileManager
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>If it says something on the lines of “cannot find command” then use full path to firefox/firefox.exe in linux/Windows respectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/firefox_2Dprofile_2Dmanager.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/firefox_2Dprofile_2Dmanager_thumb.jpg" alt="Firefox-profile-manager">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step 2.) Press “Create Profile” and enter “Incognito” (or a name of your choice) as your new profile name and press “Finish”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/firefox_2Dprofile_2Dmanager2.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/firefox_2Dprofile_2Dmanager2_thumb.jpg" alt="Firefox-profile-manager2">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step 3.) Select “Incognito” profile and press “Start Firefox”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/firefox_2Dprofile_2Dmanager3.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/firefox_2Dprofile_2Dmanager3_thumb.jpg" alt="Firefox-profile-manager3">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step 4.) Go to Edit-&amp;gt;Preferences-&amp;gt;Privacy. Select “Always clear my private data when I close Firefox” and unselect “Ask me before clearing private data”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/firefox_2Dprivacy_2Dpreferences.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/firefox_2Dprivacy_2Dpreferences_thumb.jpg" alt="Firefox-privacy-preferences">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step 5.) That’s it. Setup is done. Now, whenever you want to go undercover, run the following command&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>firefox -P Incognito -no-remote
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Note 1: You can run incognito mode and normal mode together simultaneously.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note 2: Its advised that you put the above command in a shortcut for easy/quick access.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Isn’t that simple? Now, can you roll back that drool factor of being able to go “undercover” in google chrome or Internet Explorer 8?&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Fixing The WordPress Drain Hole Pugin v2.1.3</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/08/10/fixing-the-wordpress-drain-hole-pugin-v213/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2008 17:36:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/08/10/fixing-the-wordpress-drain-hole-pugin-v213/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you use the awesome download manager plugin &amp;ldquo;Drain Hole&amp;rdquo; for your WordPress blog (A short review &lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/29/wordpress-must-have-plugins-download-managers.html">here&lt;/a>), and upgraded to the latest version 2.1.3, you must have noticed that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t scan and add new files to the download repositories now.

This time I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you some of the things that I do to find the best price for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Use Price Comparison Engines&lt;/strong>: These engines will let you search for your desired products and provide a comparison of the costs at which they are available at different stores online as well as offline. Two of my favourites are &lt;a href="http://www.pricegrabber.com/">Price Grabber&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://www.froogle.com/">Froogle&lt;/a>. Price Grabber has the added benefits of providing user reviews about the product as well.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>Last time we discussed &lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/2008/06/02/tip-gadgets-deals-and-stuff-you-need-to-know-part-i.html">how to select the gadget&lt;/a> that you want to buy.

Price Grabber has the added benefits of providing user reviews about the product as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Deal Sites&lt;/strong>: Many sites across the web aggregate the latest deals. Some are run by the site owners, e.g., &lt;a href="http://www.deals2buy.com/">Deals2Buy&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://www.hotdealsclub.com/">HotDealsClub&lt;/a> etc, which are mostly almost same to each other. Some are run by the community, e.g. &lt;a href="http://slickdeals.net/">slickdeals&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://fatwallet.com/">fatwallet&lt;/a>, etc. These have an added advantage that the discussion that takes place on the original discussion adds a lot of value and insight in terms of how to stack on even better deals on top of it, provides comparison to other deals, rumours about coming deals in advance, and even deals local to your state, city or a particular store as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Bargain Sites&lt;/strong>: These sites sell overstocked products at a cheap price. Some of the popular ones are &lt;a href="http://overstock.com/">Overstock&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://www.smartbargains.com/">Smart Bargains&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://woot.com/">W00t&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://stootsi.com/">Stootsi&lt;/a>, etc. W00t and Stootsi are a bit different in the sense that they have very limited number of products available at a time for sale (generally just 1).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Coupon Codes Sites&lt;/strong>: Many sites aggregate coupon codes for various online and offline stores that you can use with your purchase to lower the price further. However, you need to go through the terms and conditions carefully as some coupons might be expired or might not work with your particular product.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mail In Rebates&lt;/strong>: Mail In Rebates are a great way to save a lot of money and even make money on buying things. Basically what you have to do is fill in a form and send it to a given address along with proof of purchase or UPC code. And anywhere between 2–10 weeks you’ll receive a check for the said amount. So, be on the lookout for mail in rebates on manufacturers’ or sellers’ sites. But beware that mail-in-rebates don’t have 100% reliability. They might take a lot of time and might not even come. So, you better depend on them only if you are in US for more than a few weeks and keep tracking them through your mail-in-rebates’ tracking site.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cash Back&lt;/strong>: Many sites give cash backs if you go to the seller’s site through them. An example for this is Fat Wallet.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Pricematch&lt;/strong>: This is a great weapon that most people don’t know about or don’t take into consideration. Many shops (generally brick n mortar ones) give a lowest price gaurantee and if you are getting a product at a cheaper rate some place else, they will give u a discount on the difference. e.g. Staples has a 110% price match policy, so if they sell smthing at 50$, and some other place sells it 40$, then they will give it to you for 50 – 1.1x(50–40) = 39$. But many shops will price match to offline shops online and some will consider online ones as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Use Your Mouth (and brains)&lt;/strong>: Don’t think wrong, you perverts ;). By mouth I mean “talking/conversing/convincing”. You can even negotiate prices at many places (Search for the BestBuy motto), and many times you need to convince the floor managers to allow you to stack on coupons after coupons over a product that is already being given at a discount and then get a couple of freebies as well ;).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Well, this is by no means a complete list but I’ve tried to list the most important ones atleast. If I missed out on something, or if you have your own strategies or sites you visit to get the best deals, please share it with us as well.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Tip: Gadgets, Deals And Stuff You Need To Know - Part I</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/06/02/tip-gadgets-deals-and-stuff-you-need-to-know-part-i/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2008 04:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/06/02/tip-gadgets-deals-and-stuff-you-need-to-know-part-i/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you are a gadget freak like me and can’t resist the temptations to buy the newest toy on the shelves, then you’d obviously want to eek out the maximum you can from whatever budget you have.

But while doing so you have to take care of a lot of things. Here is Part I of the few things that I do get the best deals out there while making sure I’m buying the right thing from the right place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first step to buying anything is obviously whether you are buying the right thing. The list of do’s and don’t and this regard are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Do not blindly go by the what the manufacturer’s site says. After all I’ll always say that I my product is the best.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Do not just make the decision based on the feature set. More features mean more possible points of failure, so a device with fewer features but better reliability is obviously much better than the one that promises the moon but only the “once in a blue -“ kinds.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Make sure to search for similar products from other manufacturers. Just because it comes from Apple’s stable doesn’t make it the best. (For the record, in general, I don’t like anything that comes from Cupertino)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Look for the reviews. Search for the reviews for the product you have in mind, but a big problem with this has now arisen with the advent of “paid reviews”. But of course, you can always turn towards the community. Read through all the site-based single person reviews as well but also look for forums and other communities related to the type of gadget you have in mind. e.g. – For cameras, DPReview is a good place to go, for WM smart phones, XDA-Developers is the place to be, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Is the after-sales support good? You don’t want to be locked out with a product that you can’t do anything about if something goes wrong.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Look also for the hidden costs of product. Many a times the base product is cheap but then it requires you to shell out a fortune in terms of required accessories to yield it’s full potential (e.g. Archos players).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Maintenance costs:e.g. Most Apple products dont have easily replaceable parts and need to be sent back to factory for even things like a new battery.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now, the list above seems small but when put into practice it isn’t. But obviously, a geek who can handle all the latest electronic gizmos can surely handle the irks that come while chosing one, and of course, within a short while, it will become second nature to you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Are there any other things that you look for buying your new boy-toy? Do let me know. Next time, we will look at how to get the best deals for the stuff you crave.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>TIP: Viewing Any PDF Online, Without A PDF Reader And For Free</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/05/23/tip-viewing-any-pdf-online-without-a-pdf-reader-and-for-free/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2008 21:42:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/05/23/tip-viewing-any-pdf-online-without-a-pdf-reader-and-for-free/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just a small tip. If you want to view a pdf and you don’t have adobe acrobat (or any other pdf reader) installed, e.g., you are sitting in a cyber cage or at a friend’s place, you can still view it.
Only thing you have to do is, just prefix the url to the online pdf with &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://www.scribd.com/vacuum?url">http://www.scribd.com/vacuum?url&lt;/a>=&amp;rdquo; and you’ll see a nice web interface rendering your pdf without having to install anything on your PC.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>Just a small tip.

Whatever new service you sign on for on the internet (especially the web2.0–oh-so-cool-you-have-to-tell-everyone-about-it ones), it gives you an option to fill in your e-mail ID and password and makes a generous offer of letting all your friends know about your new avatar and let them all join in the fun. Most of the people around me, it seems, don’t think twice before gladly accepting the offer, as is made apparent from the increasing amount of automated mails I’m getting with subjects like “Hey, don’t be left out! Join me on X” or “Hi SG, Why don’t you follow me on Y”.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>For the past many years, I’ve seen a trend that has been on a meteoric rise. Whatever new service you sign on for on the internet (especially the web2.0–oh-so-cool-you-have-to-tell-everyone-about-it ones), it gives you an option to fill in your e-mail ID and password and makes a generous offer of letting all your friends know about your new avatar and let them all join in the fun. Most of the people around me, it seems, don’t think twice before gladly accepting the offer, as is made apparent from the increasing amount of automated mails I’m getting with subjects like “Hey, don’t be left out! Join me on X” or “Hi SG, Why don’t you follow me on Y”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I just wanted to “remind” you all (because you already know it) how important your password is. You keep it safe from everyone, suspect even your friends of trying to hack into your e-mail, and then you give it away to an “unknown” entity with so much of ease, laying so much trust onto it that you won’t even put in your biological parents.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While many of these services are genuine, but many might not be. I’m certainly against handing out your passwords to a third-party web service until it is something like google that won’t just sell you off one fine day and run off somewhere you can’t find it. But if you are compelled to do so because of some reason, I’d recommend atleast checking out what it has to say about the data it’s collecting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let me take an example of a new IM service that I recently came across. It’s called IMO (or imo or whatever) and is apparently quite popular because of its multiple IM service connections through a single interface. I thought of checking out its terms etc and making a mental image of how respectable / trustworthy I found it. I had listed the following things on the blog where I had found about this site. Listing them here again for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following are the nuggets I found:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>1.&lt;/strong> They have a blogspot blog. It takes hardly a few minutes to host ur own blog on ur own domain. Maybe they have some existing google connection but yet to discover it.(I read somewhere that some of these people worked at google in the past but that’s no reason to keep your blog on such a platform)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2.&lt;/strong> Shady privacy agreement.
** 2a** They mention that not only will they save ur username and pwd but may also save ur chats/messages etc.
** 2b** They might also share info with 3rd parties (written in a manner that they can do it on their own will)
** 2c** Transparency: They might not even tell u whats going on if they so decide.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please don’t mention about the eliteness of their “advisor panel”. This is the biggest marketing gimmick that everyone pulls off. Many times the &amp;ldquo;advisors&amp;rdquo; don&amp;rsquo;t even know the &amp;ldquo;advised&amp;rdquo; company exists.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>IMP:&lt;/strong> If a site doesn’t say anything or says all goody things in its terms, that doesn’t make it clean, but if you find suspiciousness in the terms, that definitely makes a negative mark. &lt;strong>In Short, when your password is concerned, treat everyone guilty until proven innocent.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Keep Tab On Home Security With A Webcam And Twitter</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/05/14/keep-tab-on-home-security-with-a-webcam-and-twitter/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2008 04:00:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/05/14/keep-tab-on-home-security-with-a-webcam-and-twitter/</guid><description>&lt;p>Worried about someone breaking into your house in your absence?

And you are set for real time updates through twitter about all that goes on at your abode behind your back (can even receive a text message/sms on your phone). Keep reading for the very simple setup you need.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Download and install &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://www.lavrsen.dk/twiki/bin/view/Motion/DownloadFiles">motion&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; on your computer. For ubuntu users, this is as simple as running&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo apt-get install motion
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Setup your motion configuration file. (Usually at /etc/motion/motion.conf). There are quite a lot of options available. You might want to tweak it a lot according to ur needs later on but the most important ones that you can begin with are (leave the rest untouched for now):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>a. Add/edit the option &amp;ldquo;target_dir&amp;rdquo; to point to the directory where you want to save the images of the event when motion is detected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>b. Add/edit the option &amp;ldquo;locate&amp;rdquo; and set it to &amp;ldquo;on&amp;rdquo; so that you get a nice square box around the detected moving object/person.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>c. Add/edit the option &amp;ldquo;webcam_port&amp;rdquo; and set it to, say, &amp;ldquo;8000&amp;rdquo;. Motion includes a mini http server so now, you can use it to view the actual images of the happening when you get the update and check for false alarms.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Now, comes the most important part, about getting the update.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>motion has an option called &amp;ldquo;on_motion_detected&amp;rdquo; and here you can specify any command or program that you want to run when motion is detected. To get the update on your twitter account, use one of the following three methods with this option.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>a. Using curl. If you have curl installed in your system, then you can use the following value for the on_motion_detected option:&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>curl -u yourusername:yourpassword -d status&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;Motion Detected! Check Immediately&amp;#34;&lt;/span> https://twitter.com/statuses/update.xml
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>b. Using wget. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have curl, you can even use wget with the following command:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>wget --post-data &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;status=Motion Detected!

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>And voila! the webcam started working like magic. Of course, this tip is only for webcams that use this particular chip. And if you want to make this change permanent so that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to run these commands everytime you want to use your webcam, all you have to do is add the following line to your /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist file&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>blacklist zc0301&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This would prevent the module from loading whenever you connect your webcam to your computer.

Please redownload the below mentioned package. It now has Oxios Close as well as Oxios Hibernate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oxios developed a very useful tool for Windows Mobile (WM2003/5/6/6.1) called &amp;ldquo;Oxios Memory&amp;rdquo; sometime ago. On running it, it&amp;rsquo;ll flush your RAM (kind of) and recover substantial amounts of memory that can be used by the currently program. It is so good at this that many people run it regularly on their phones, and most of them want to run it in an automated mode (through a scheduler or a script). But the problem (so far) was that it generates a Message Box at the end for which the user has to press &amp;ldquo;OK&amp;rdquo; button to make it go away. There is no known way of disabling this message box and many attempts to work around it by scripting the &amp;ldquo;press OK&amp;rdquo; action have been very unreliable at best. Hence, it took it upon me today to remove this nagging problem and 5 minutes later we have a &amp;ldquo;clean&amp;rdquo; Oxios Memory.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>**Update: **Modified the &amp;ldquo;Oxios Hibernate&amp;rdquo; app as well on public demand.

However, many people complain that although their smb/Samba shares are accessible from Windows, they are not able to do the same with their Windows Mobile devices. e.g., using a tool called &amp;ldquo;Resco Explorer&amp;rdquo; on Windows Mobile, all they get while searching for their linux based Samba shares is the following screenshot:&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>If you have ever needed to share files between your Linux and Windows computers, you have obviously used &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_(software)">Samba&lt;/a>, and have been quite happy with the way it seamlessly provides access to and from shared folders/files from Windows and Linux.

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/1_cant_find_computer.jpg" alt="Cannot Find Computer on Network">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, there is no big magic trick to get an access to those shares, as they are already accessibly. You just need to do one more teeny little step to access them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The trick is that on Windows Mobile it will not detect your computer as having a shareable folder and will not show it, and it will thus not show a list of shared folders. So, what you need to do is enter the path to the folder you want to access. e.g.: If your computer&amp;rsquo;s name is &amp;ldquo;MyComp&amp;rdquo; and the folder you want to access is &amp;ldquo;MyFolder&amp;rdquo;, then you need to give the path &amp;ldquo;\MyComp\MyFolder&amp;rdquo; to the application on Windows Mobile from which you are trying to access your shares and it&amp;rsquo;ll connect without any problems. Of course, it&amp;rsquo;ll ask you for your username/pwd for which you need to enter your linux user name and password. Below screenshots tell you how to do this with Resco Explorer, however the same method can be used for other applications like Total Commander, Windows Mobile File Explorer, etc as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Enter Path and click share.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/2_enter_full_path.jpg" alt="Enter Full Path">&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>Enter User Name / Password&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/3_enter_user_password.jpg" alt="Enter User Name And Password">&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>Its done :-)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/4_its_done.jpg" alt="Access To Share Is Done">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Rahul (my friend and guest author on this blog) introduced me to an old-but-useful trick a few days ago that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about. It&amp;rsquo;s about customizing nautilus to display a context menu that has a few of your chosen scripts to weave their magic on the selected object. And the procedure to do this is summarized in just two steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Write your script.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Save it in ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts and make it executable&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Of course, if you don&amp;rsquo;t know scripting the first step itself is quite daunting, but you can get a lot of pre-cooked scripts on the internet by searching for &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=nautilus+scripts&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search">nautilus scripts&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;. e.g. take a look at &lt;a href="http://g-scripts.sourceforge.net/">g-scripts homepage&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To get you started immediately, here is a crude example to open a terminal/console window in any folder/path through right-click menu:&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Step 1) Write your script (any scripting language: shell, perl, python, etc):&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">#!/bin/bash
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">&lt;/span>gnome-terminal --working-directory&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&lt;/span>$1&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Step 2) Save it in ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts, name it as &amp;ldquo;Terminal&amp;rdquo; and make it executable.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>chmod +x Terminal
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Step 3) Now, you should see a &amp;ldquo;Scripts&amp;rdquo; option in your right-click menu as shown below. Clicking on &amp;ldquo;Terminal&amp;rdquo; will open a new terminal window with the present working directory being set to the selected folder.
&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/nautilus_scripts.png">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/nautilus_scripts_thumb.jpg" alt="Nautilus_scripts">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note:&lt;/strong> If you don&amp;rsquo;t see the &amp;ldquo;scripts&amp;rdquo; menu option (or your script name in the extended menu), then just run&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sudo killall nautilus
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Let me know if you face any problems with this or have any other questions.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Ubuntu TIP: Automating Package Installation – apt-get to the rescue</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/06/ubuntu-tip-automating-package-installation--apt-get-to-the-rescue/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2008 03:30:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/06/ubuntu-tip-automating-package-installation--apt-get-to-the-rescue/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Admin Note:&lt;/strong> Rahul is a long time friend of mine, and is a well known geek amongst his friends and colleagues.

If yes, then cheer up buddy, because all you really need is some magic (read scripting), some typing and spend some time digging the package names of your favourite applications.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To get started, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to type the package information in a configuration file. The format of the file is really simple&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Any line starting with a # is ignored&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Blank lines are ignored&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Any other line, the first word is taken as the package name you want to install&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

You can give it a option “-newer” followed by a f”&lt;em>filename&lt;/em>” and it will return the names of the files that are newer than &lt;em>filename&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>find ~ -type f -newer ~/backups/backup_x.tgz &amp;gt; files.txt
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>So, the command given above will find all the files that have changed since you took the backup “&lt;em>backup_x.tgz&lt;/em>” and store those filenames and paths into “_files.txt”. _The “-type f” option makes sure that only filenames are listed and not directory names, because tar creates a lot of issues when presented with directory names (Explore yourself about this).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, all we have to do is give this “&lt;em>files.txt&lt;/em>” to tar as an input to tell it which files to archive.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>tar cvzpGf ~/backups/backup_$date.tgz -T files.txt
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The “-T files.txt” option makes this happen. Moreover, I have introduced 2 new options here, that were not present in our last part. They are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>p – Tells tar to preserve file permissions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>G – Tells tar to ignore any file read errors etc and continue&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Apart from this, you can also take a look at the “-mtime x” option for find command which lets you specify to list files which have changed in past x days. There are other similar options available for find. Look at “man find” and take your pick. Similar options exist for tar, but I have had a lot of weird issues using them, so I’d recommend sticking with this two step process of “find” followed by “tar”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, the above mentioned commands and options can be used in innumerous ways and combinations to achieve your perfect balance of space and ease of use etc for backups. I’ll list down a sample script here, that will make a full backup on every first day of the week, and then make incremental backups over each day for rest 6 days. So, you’ll save a lot of space (more than 5 times), but you will have to use all 7 backup files to make a full restore. (I’m listing just the backup part, you can add the “mutt” command yourself, for e-mailing as mentioned in &lt;a href="http://tech.shantanugoel.com/2008/02/17/tip-automating-website-backups.html">Part I&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>

&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>So?? Did you know that WordPress can import from WordPress?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, WordPress gives you way to &amp;ldquo;export&amp;rdquo; your blog into an XML file that they call as &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Panels#Import">WordPress eXtended RSS&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; (or WXR in short). And then, you can just wipe out everything (or go to your new server), install WP afresh and just import this file into it. A no frills, easy way to make your blog lean again, without losing out on any content.&lt;/p>

And yeah, one at a time so it can keep your tummy full till I return.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, being honest, you will have to do just a tad little bit more than that, but it’ll be a teeny weeny bit only, I promise. Read on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are using the WordPress web interface to make your posts (are you still living in the darkages? Didn’t you hear about BlogJet, Live Writer, Zoundry?), then all you have to do is that when you make your post, before pressing the publish button, look towards your lower left hand corner (No man, I mean the lower left corner of “the screen”, not your table). You will see something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/wordpress_future_post_time1.png" alt="Wordpress_future_post_time1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, all you gotta do is, check that little checkbox that says “Edit Timestamp” and then change the date and time to the time when you want to be actually published. Click “Publish”, and then….well, that’s it. You are done. It will look something like this (the post will be published on Feb 26, 9:30 AM):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/wordpress_future_post_time2.png" alt="Wordpress_future_post_time2">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, you are indeed keeping up with the modern times, you say, and are using cool desktop client tools, e.g. ,I use BlogJet (and that too over linux, read &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/2008/01/29/blogjet-blog-faster-blog-better-now-in-linux-too-with-a-hidden-bonus.html">this&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> for more). So what can we do about that. Its pretty simple really, almost the same thing. Again, look in the lower left corner, and you see:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/blogjet_future_post_time1.png" alt="Blogjet_future_post_time1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Obviously, you are intelligent enough to modify it to look like this before pressing the lovely, earthy publish button:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/blogjet_future_post_time2.png" alt="Blogjet_future_post_time2">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All set? No, there is one little difference in this method. When you are posting through a desktop client, the post time seem to be interpreted in GMT in WordPress, so you have to discount for that. e.g., as an example if my time zone is +6:00 wrt GMT, I have put in the time as 3:30 AM in BlogJet to achieve the same publish time (Feb 26, 09:30 AM local time).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hope this was easy enough for you. If it was, then don’t forget to spend the extra time on weekdays buying groceries and taking some burden off your wife/mom/etc.&lt;/p>

So, thought of doing a few follow ups to that post. This is done in more of a FAQ fashion, so as to answer some of the questions that may arise after reading the first post. Each post will answer one of the questions listed below in detail&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Questions to be answered:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q1:&lt;/strong> I have strict limits on webspace/email attachment etc. Can anything be done to reduce the backup size?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Q2: **Cron? Using tar, making up the script file is enough command line for me. Isn’t there an easy way?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q3:&lt;/strong> Well, backup is all hunky-dory. Now, how do I restore?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Want the answers? Read on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q1:&lt;/strong> I have strict limits on webspace/email attachment etc. Can anything be done to reduce the backup size?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**A1: **Sure, we can do quite a lot about it. If your concern is just the webspace, and you want a very simple restoring process, you should be looking for reducing the number of backups that you save on the server, instead of reducing the size of the backup (you anyways have all the backups mailed out to you). The number of backups can be reduced by manipulating the command given in step 1 of the previous post. To recall, the command was:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>tar cvzf ~/backups/backup_&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">`&lt;/span>date +%w&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">`&lt;/span>.tgz ~/public_html
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Here, the &lt;code>date +%w&lt;/code> part ensured that at any time there will be 7 previous backups at max stored on the server (backup_0.tgz, backup_1.tgz,…). You can remove this part and every day your previous backup will be overwritten by the new one, thus using space for just 1 backup. And since you have all the backups emailed to you as well, you don’t need to worry about restoring back to any point in time. Its just that having the backup on your server saves some time if you do have to restore since you don’t have to upload the backup file onto the server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>BUT&lt;/strong>, if you must place restriction on your backup size (backup is so big that that your email can’t handle it as an attachment or you are really really pressed for webspace or backing up all the files takes up too much time/cpu of the host server), then you can save yourself by backing up only the files that need to be backed up. What does that mean? All CMS (Content Management Systems like Joomla, WordPress, Drupal, or your custom ones, or even a manually made site) will have some/many static components/files which don’t change with time, and so these files don’t need to be backed up every time. You can just backup the files that change or the ones that get added (like images, uploads etc).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, all you have to do is determine which files you &lt;strong>don’t&lt;/strong> want backed up, create a list for them and supply it to the _tar _command, with the _—exclude-from _option, and tar will dutifully avoid zipping those files up, leaving you with only the most needed files.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>tar cvzf ~/backups/backup_&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">`&lt;/span>date +%w&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">`&lt;/span>.tgz ~/public_html —exclude-from&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>exclude_these_files.txt
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now, there are two ways to go about determining which files you don’t need. First is that you simply run “&lt;em>ls -R &amp;gt; exclude_these_files.txt”&lt;/em> on the root of your home directory on the server (the folder beneath which your &lt;em>public_html&lt;/em> or &lt;em>www&lt;/em> folder resides). Then fire up your favourite editor and load this file into that and delete the file names from the file which you want to back up, leaving only those filenames in the file which you don’t want to backup. Generally, you would be interested in backing up any files that you have uploaded yourself onto the server (like images, archives, songs, any other files that you uploaded, any files that you modified, etc)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are not sure which files you should be backing up and you don’t want to backup all files, then there is still hope for you, but only if you are reading this guide before starting a new site &lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/smile3.gif" alt="">. Because then, before making any posts or customizations, you can just run the above mentioned &lt;em>ls&lt;/em> command, and you will have a list of the default files that are always there with your CMS and you don’t need to back them up. However, make sure that if you ever change any of the default files, do delete their names from the exclude_these_files.txt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s it for today. Lemme know if you have any doubts, or if you would like to see any other questions answered in this series. The question that will be answered next time is:&lt;/p>

It can get hacked, you may install something wrong, a wrong configuration can wreak havoc, the server hard disk might crash, natural calamities, and what not. Your best option to secure yourself against all this is summarized in just one word “BACKUP”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, a backup involves two most important things: “Database Backup” and “Files Backup”. Most webhosts give you the options to back these up for you but with a few catches:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You can backup but only through your control panel manually. No automation/scheduling of backups.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Automated Backing up is not free&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Automated Backing up is free but restoring is not as they give you the backed up data only on request.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There are many plugins available for most CMS and blogging sw for backing up databases. But what about the files? Especially if you have more than one sites on one hosting account. Well, here I’ll tell you how to automate file backups in three simple steps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note: This guide is only for linux based hosts. But you can follow a similar approach for windows based hosting as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step 1) Backup through command line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can use “tar” for this. With tar, you can create compressed archives quickly for a complete directory tree.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>tar cvzf ~/backups/backup_`date +%w`.tgz ~/public_html
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Explanation:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>tar is the name of the command&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>c =&amp;gt; compress v=&amp;gt; verbose z=&amp;gt;gzip for compression&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;del>/backups =&amp;gt; backup directory where ur backups will be stored (&lt;/del> is shortcut for your home directory). It is generally a good practice to store your backups in a directory not directly accessible through http, i.e., outside your public_html directory.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>backup_&lt;code>date +%w&lt;/code>.tgz =&amp;gt; forms the name of the backup file in the form &lt;code>backup_&amp;lt;dayofweek&amp;gt;.tgz&lt;/code>. This will form a circular buffer kind of scenario where backups more than 1 week later will automatically be overwritten by latest ones to avoid using up all your webspace. You can modify this according to your need and available webspace by taking a look at man page of “date” command. (Run “man date” on command line)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>~/public_html =&amp;gt; is the directory you want to backup. Most probably your website will be located in this directory. If not sure, then check with your webhost.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Step 2) Mailing the backup to yourself through command line. (The server might develop some problem, hard disk might crash or your backups on server might be lost, so this is a good option to have)&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-mysql" data-lang="mysql">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>mutt &lt;span style="color:#f92672">-&lt;/span>s &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;Backup `date`&amp;#34;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">-&lt;/span>a &lt;span style="color:#f92672">~/&lt;/span>backups&lt;span style="color:#f92672">/&lt;/span>backup_&lt;span style="color:#f92672">`&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">date&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">+%&lt;/span>w&lt;span style="color:#f92672">`&lt;/span>.tgz myuserid&lt;span style="color:#f92672">@&lt;/span>mymail.com
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Explanation:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>mutt =&amp;gt; mailing user agent that sends the mail (You can use others, but I prefer mutt)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>-s &amp;ldquo;Backup &lt;code>date&lt;/code>&amp;rdquo; =&amp;gt; -s option is to specify the subject of the mail on command line. This line will specify the backup date as subject.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>-a ~/backups/backup_&lt;code>date +%w&lt;/code>.tgz =&amp;gt; -a option specifies the file to be attached.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="mailto:myuserid@mymail.com">myuserid@mymail.com&lt;/a> =&amp;gt; Specify the mail id t which the email has to be sent&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;/dev/null =&amp;gt; The body of the email is empty. If you want some text to be here, you can form a file, say “email.txt” and write the contents in it and replace the above part with “&amp;lt;email.txt”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Step 3) Final Step. Automating it all. What you need to do is add the above commands into a script and then find a way to make it run automatically.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The script looks like:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">#!/bin/bash
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">&lt;/span> tar cvzf ~/backups/backup_&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">`&lt;/span>date +%w&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">`&lt;/span>.tgz ~/public_html
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> mutt -s &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;Backup `date`&amp;#34;&lt;/span> -a ~/backups/backup_&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">`&lt;/span>date +%w&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">`&lt;/span>.tgz myuserid@mymail.com
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Save it as “backup.sh” and make it executable by running “chmod +x backup.sh”. We’ll assume that you save it in ~/backups directory. You can store it anywhere, just remember it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, you need to tell the server to run it automatically at a specified time. We’ll use “cron” for this. (If you are not comfortable with command line, then login to your website control panel, and look for an option called cron, where you can make the schedule graphically) Run the following command:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>crontab -e
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This will open a file with your scheduled tasks info. Make sure that you don’t touch any of the existing lines. Add the following line at the end.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>MAILTO=&amp;#34;myusername&amp;#34;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>00 22 * * * ~/backups/backup.sh
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The first line will make sure that the output of the script, any errors etc, are sent to the your local mail account, that you can check for debugging purposes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second line is of the format “# m h dom mon dow command”
m=&amp;gt; minute of the hour
h=&amp;raquo; hour of the day
dom=&amp;gt; Day of month
mon=&amp;gt; month of year
dow=&amp;gt; day of week
command=&amp;gt; command that you want to run
So, the command mentioned above will run the command every day at 10:00 PM GMT. You can modify the line according to your needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s it. You are done. Just wait for the specified time, and then check your mailbox for the backup file. Let me know if you face any problems, have any issues, or want to ask any questions about cuztomizing it for yourself.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>TIP: Switching Soundcards In Ubuntu</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/12/tip-switching-soundcards-in-ubuntu/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Feb 2008 18:00:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/12/tip-switching-soundcards-in-ubuntu/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you have multiple soundcards in your system and have to switch between them regularly (e.g. laptop owners like me, who use an external soundcard while being docked to groove to the highest and the lowest of frequencies through those 7.1 channels and use the in-built sound card while on the move) you would definitely be under-whelmed by the less-than-stellar performance of ubuntu in switching between the sound cards. For me at least, ubuntu (fiesty 7.04 amd64) never seems to recognize that I&amp;rsquo;ve connected the speakers to my Audigy 2 ZS Notebook PCMCIA card, and merrily continues to huff-puff through the tinny laptop speakers until I manually go into the sound preferences, switch over to multichannel playback and vice versa. Well, I still haven&amp;rsquo;t found an automated solution for the switching, but here is a little cli-magic to do this in a click.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>If you have multiple soundcards in your system and have to switch between them regularly (e.g. laptop owners like me, who use an external soundcard while being docked to groove to the highest and the lowest of frequencies through those 7.1 channels and use the in-built sound card while on the move) you would definitely be under-whelmed by the less-than-stellar performance of ubuntu in switching between the sound cards.

Well, I still haven&amp;rsquo;t found an automated solution for the switching, but here is a little cli-magic to do this in a click.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have alsa on ur system, just use the command &amp;ldquo;asoundconf list&amp;rdquo; first to list out all the soundcards connected to your system. e.g. on my system, the output is&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$asoundconf list
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>IXP
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>AUDIGY2
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Here, IXP is my internal sound card and AUDIGY2 is my external (PCMCIA) sound card. Now, all you need to is use &lt;code>asoundconf set-default-card &amp;lt;cardname&amp;gt;&lt;/code> to switch over to any card desired. So, what I did was make 2 bash scripts, and insert this command in them with each having one of my soundcards&amp;rsquo; names.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>script 1 - setixp.sh&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">#!/bin/bash
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">&lt;/span>asoundconf set-default-card IXP
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Similarly, script 2 - setaudigy.sh&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">#!/bin/bash
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">&lt;/span>asoundconf set-default-card AUDIGY2
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now, all that remains is save the two scripts (maybe in ur home directory or ur desktop), and make them executable (use &lt;code>chmod +x &amp;lt;scriptname&amp;gt;&lt;/code>). Now, whenever you want to switch to a card, just double-click on the appropriate script, and watch the sound getting redirected. oops, make that &amp;ldquo;hear&amp;rdquo; the sound :P.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Tips: Configure FTP upload support for wordpress in Blogjet</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/07/tips-configure-ftp-upload-support-for-wordpress-in-blogjet/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Feb 2008 14:36:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/07/tips-configure-ftp-upload-support-for-wordpress-in-blogjet/</guid><description>&lt;p>A few days ago, I had written about a wonderful blogging tool &lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/2008/01/29/blogjet-blog-faster-blog-better-now-in-linux-too-with-a-hidden-bonus.html">Blogjet&lt;/a>. Now, if you host a wordpress blog, you’d be aware of the fact that for wordpress to be able to upload yor files (images, attachements in post etc) to the server, you have to make the upload directory writable by all.

Now, if you host a wordpress blog, you’d be aware of the fact that for wordpress to be able to upload yor files (images, attachements in post etc) to the server, you have to make the upload directory writable by all. Now, this is a BIG security risk. Some people go to the lengths of CHMOD’ding their upload directory for a short while and after upload, restoring the apt file permissions back. Some upload their files separately through ftp. But Blogjet has a very cool feature.

This saves you a lot of time, that you can then devote on writing the actual post instead of meandering around with the “technicalities”. But many a people have a heart-ache configuring the ftp with Blogjet, although it is quite simple really. This is basically due to conflicting and confusing instructions existing on the ‘net. So, here I present to you step by step, simplest instrutions to configure this. Read on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step1) Launch Blogjet. You will be presented with a login screen (shown below). You can create a new account or choose to edit an existing one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/1_blogjet_login_screen.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/1_blogjet_login_screen_thumb.jpg" alt="1_blogjet_login_screen">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step2) Choose “I have a blog” on the next screen. Press next.(You might not get this screen if you are editing an old account. In that case, skip to Step 3)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/2_blogjet_create_blog.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/2_blogjet_create_blog_thumb.jpg" alt="2_blogjet_create_blog">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step3) In the “Edit connection Settings” dialog, click on “Configure Settings Manually”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/3_blogjet_settings.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/3_blogjet_settings_thumb.jpg" alt="3_blogjet_settings">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step4) In the Connection settings dialog, there are two options for wordpress blogs. “Wordpress” and “Wordpress (Direct Upload)”. Choose “Wordpress”. The direct upload feature is for people whose wordpress installations have necessary permissions to create files on the server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/4_blojget_account_settings.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/4_blojget_account_settings_thumb.jpg" alt="4_blojget_account_settings">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step5) Enter the username and password for your blog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/5_blogjet_username.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/5_blogjet_username_thumb.jpg" alt="5_blogjet_username">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step6) Now, you get the FTP Configuration screen. Check out the image below and then read the instructions for filling up various columns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/6_blogjet_config_ftp.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/6_blogjet_config_ftp_thumb.jpg" alt="6_blogjet_config_ftp">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i) Tick the checkbox which says “Use FTP to upload pictures…..”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ii) FTP Server: ftp address for your server. e.g.: &lt;a href="ftp://ftp.mysite.com/">ftp.mysite.com&lt;/a> .If you don’t know this, then you should contact your webhost support staff to know about this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>iii) Port: Generally ftp port is 21. However, if you are not sure, then ask your webhost support staff to get the exact number.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>iv) Remote Folder: This is the folder where you want to upload your stuff but is relative to the path where your ftp connection lands you. You’ll need to make a manual ftp connection to your ftp server first to check this. Check the examples after next step.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>v) Base URL: This is the complete web path, that wordpress (or any user over the web) will use to access the image.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Examples: If your ftp server address is &lt;a href="ftp://ftp.mysite.com/">ftp.mysite.com&lt;/a>, and your wordpress blog address is &lt;a href="http://blog.mysite.com/">http://blog.mysite.com&lt;/a> . Your file directory structure is something like given below:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>/-&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>/public_html -&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>/public_html/wordpress
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>/another_folder
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>When you connect to ftp manuall, you land up at “/”, you make a new folder at /public_html/wordpress/uploads, where you are going to upload your files. And your blog address &lt;a href="http://blog.mysite.com/">http://blog.mysite.com&lt;/a> points at /public_html/wordpress/ when you go to it through your web browser, then your field values will be:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remote Folder: /public_html/wordpress/uploads&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Base URL: &lt;a href="http://blog.mysite.com/uploads">http://blog.mysite.com/uploads&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notes: So, basically what you can do is for remote folder, connect to ftp, “cd” to the folder where you want to upload and do “pwd”, this is your remote folder address. For Base url, find out, where your blog address points to (take help of your webhost support if u need), then find your upload folder’s path relative to it, and add that relative path in front of your blog address.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>vi) Username/password: This is your ftp username and password given to you by your webhost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>vii) Now, click on “Test this configuration”. If everything is ok, then you’ll get a “FTP Configured properly” message as shown below. Then click ok and next.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/7_blogjet_ftp_configured.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/7_blogjet_ftp_configured_thumb.jpg" alt="7_blogjet_ftp_configured">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step7) Click on finish. You are done. &lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/smile1.gif" alt="">. Do let me know if this worked for you or you had any issues.&lt;/p>
