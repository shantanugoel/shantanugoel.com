To get the best network with the new gigabit ethernet port on the raspi, and still save power, I added a PoE hat to it so I could power the raspi as well as provide it data through the ethernet port. Everything worked fine except that I ocassionaly got into situations where the raspi stopped responding suddenly. Initially I thought that it&amp;rsquo;s crashing due to some issues and used to just restart it manually.</description></item><item><title>Practical Reverse Engineering Tutorials Part 2: Protostar Stack4</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2017/12/04/practical-reverse-engineering-tutorial-2-protostar-stack4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Dec 2017 21:04:24 +0530</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2017/12/04/practical-reverse-engineering-tutorial-2-protostar-stack4/</guid><description>About the challenge In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll go through the Protostar stack4 challenge. This would be a bit similar to the stack0 challenge that we already tackled earlier, but it will think about an interesting way to get alternate code to execute instead of just modifying data.
Pre-requisite: Make sure you&amp;rsquo;ve completed the Part 1 of the Practical Reverse Engineering Tutorials series. It&amp;rsquo;d also be great if you can try stack1-stack3 challenges on your own as they are similar to stack0.</description></item><item><title>Practical Reverse Engineering Tutorials Part 1: Introduction &amp; Protostar Stack 0</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2017/11/16/practical-reverse-engineering-tutorial-1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:46:24 +0530</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2017/11/16/practical-reverse-engineering-tutorial-1/</guid><description>What is this about? This article is the 1st part of the Practical Reverse Engineering Tutorials series. This series is geared towards a structured, but almost completely practical, approach to learn Reverse Engineering. Many of the existing articles/books take a long winded approach to teach RE which is prefixed with a lot of theory before the reader can get their hands dirty. This series will take a different approach of picking up various challenges in the order of increasing difficulty and help the reader in exploring ways how to break them.</description></item><item><title>email-actions: An SMTP server that triggers actions from email</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2017/04/03/email-actions-trigger-tasks-from-email-smtp-server/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2017 19:20:59 +0530</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2017/04/03/email-actions-trigger-tasks-from-email-smtp-server/</guid><description>Releasing my project email-actions today.

Well, as part of my home network overhaul, I moved over from the consumer grade (but still decent enough) Asus router over to Ubiquiti stack which, among other things, lead me to use their &amp;ldquo;Unify Security Gateway (USG)&amp;rdquo; as the router. Now, this router is pretty decent and is running Ubiquiti&amp;rsquo;s EdgeOS (derived from Vyatta OS, which in turn is based on linux/debian).</description></item><item><title>ACT Fibernet blocks sites using deep packet inspection</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2017/01/24/act-fibernet-deep-packet-inspection-blocking-sites/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jan 2017 16:04:28 +0530</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2017/01/24/act-fibernet-deep-packet-inspection-blocking-sites/</guid><description>ISPs in India have been blocking websites since many years. It&amp;rsquo;s often done without much sense to it. The goveernment/telecom bodies and courts sometimes tell the ISPs to block content instead of telling the same to the websites that host the content. Sometimes, the orders are to block certain urls and ISPs are over-enthusiastic in implementing the orders and block complete websites. It&amp;rsquo;s all frustrating but it becomes enraging when you find out that the ISPs are messing with your traffic in a less than ethical way to implement this.</description></item><item><title>Indian ISP ACT Fibernet blocks bit.ly.

Indian ISP ACT FibernetÂ (aka Beam Telecom) hijacks its users&amp;rsquo; DNS requests (even when using public DNS servers like Google or OpenDNS) and blocks websites through this method. This has huge implications beyond website blocking and you can&amp;rsquo;t rely on anything that you are browsing anymore though there are ways available to make yourself safe.
Aside: Indian ISPs are blocking benign/collateral damage sites now like bit.</description></item><item><title>NTP Driver For ESP8266</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2015/03/01/ntp-driver-for-esp8266/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2015 08:02:22 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2015/03/01/ntp-driver-for-esp8266/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m building a smartwatch project based around the new IoT posterkid on the block, ESP8266.

With a sigh of relief I subscribed immediately and it was stellar at home with its wonderful 32 million song collection and chromecast support to boot. The experience during the commute daily was underwhelming. Couple the spotty airtel data connection with no one station covering all songs I would love and it makes for a frustrating commute with long gaps all over.</description></item><item><title>Browser controlled Raspberry Pi Camera Car</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2014/08/03/browser-controlled-raspberry-pi-camera-car/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Aug 2014 15:33:12 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2014/08/03/browser-controlled-raspberry-pi-camera-car/</guid><description>Spent this weekend building a remote controlled car with a live camera feed with a Raspberry Pi doing the communication and brains duty.

Whatever maybe the reason, the main point is that because of this hard disk, now we cannot just turn off the power of the router any more.</description></item><item><title>Microtek UPS Problems (And A Solution)</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/05/10/microtek-ups-problems-solution/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 May 2009 15:35:02 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/05/10/microtek-ups-problems-solution/</guid><description>I got myself a Microtek 800VA UPS (MDP800+) aÂ coupleÂ of weeks ago to save my PS3 from the frequent power outages that we are seeing in Hyderabad but the purpose was rather lost when I found that it worked fine only till the mains power was on.

Oxios developed a very useful tool for Windows Mobile (WM2003/5/6/6.1) called &amp;ldquo;Oxios Memory&amp;rdquo; sometime ago. On running it, it&amp;rsquo;ll flush your RAM (kind of) and recover substantial amounts of memory that can be used by the currently program. It is so good at this that many people run it regularly on their phones, and most of them want to run it in an automated mode (through a scheduler or a script).</description></item><item><title>TIP: Make Those Linux Samba Shares Accessible From Windows Mobile</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/30/tip-make-those-linux-samba-shares-accessible-from-windows-mobile/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2008 10:30:12 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/30/tip-make-those-linux-samba-shares-accessible-from-windows-mobile/</guid><description>If you have ever needed to share files between your Linux and Windows computers, you have obviously used Samba, and have been quite happy with the way it seamlessly provides access to and from shared folders/files from Windows and Linux. However, many people complain that although their smb/Samba shares are accessible from Windows, they are not able to do the same with their Windows Mobile devices. e.g., using a tool called &amp;ldquo;Resco Explorer&amp;rdquo; on Windows Mobile, all they get while searching for their linux based Samba shares is the following screenshot:</description></item><item><title>Ubuntu TIP: Extending Nautilus, Scripting Your Way To UI Bliss</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/09/ubuntu-tip-extending-nautilus-scripting-your-way-to-ui-bliss/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2008 16:10:18 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/09/ubuntu-tip-extending-nautilus-scripting-your-way-to-ui-bliss/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m back from my vacation and this is a smallish post before we return to our regular programming (I&amp;rsquo;m full of puns ).

Well, this is a short note further developing on the approaches discussed there. Basically, telling tar to backup only those files which have changed. For this, Linux has a command âfindâ which I am very fond of. You can give it a option â-newerâ followed by a fâfilenameâ and it will return the names of the files that are newer than filename.</description></item><item><title>TIP: Move Your WordPress Blog, And Leave The Trash Behind</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/27/tip-move-your-wordpress-blog-and-leave-the-trash-behind/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Feb 2008 04:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/27/tip-move-your-wordpress-blog-and-leave-the-trash-behind/</guid><description>If you are moving your blog, or just want to start afresh, you would definitely use some way to import your old content into the new place, instead of manually copying and pasting everything. Generally this means saving your database and importing into the new place. But:
You have seen WordPress importing your/others&amp;rsquo; blogs from other services automatically. Wasn&amp;rsquo;t that quick and easy.
Your databse has become overly full of so much trash over the years and you would like to trim out all the fat and take just the meat (the posts, pages, comments, tags, custom fields etc)</description></item><item><title>TIP: WordPress Posts Scheduling - Back To The Future (or Blast From The Past?)</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/26/tip-wordpress-posts-scheduling-back-to-the-future-or-blast-from-the-past/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Feb 2008 04:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/26/tip-wordpress-posts-scheduling-back-to-the-future-or-blast-from-the-past/</guid><description>If you are like me (I mean underpaid, overworked, coding zombie), then the only time you find for blogging is weekends.

Your online abode is so difficult to keep secured.

Your best option to secure yourself against all this is summarized in just one word âBACKUPâ.

Now, if you host a wordpress blog, youâd be aware of the fact that for wordpress to be able to upload yor files (images, attachements in post etc) to the server, you have to make the upload directory writable by all. Now, this is a BIG security risk. Some people go to the lengths of CHMODâding their upload directory for a short while and after upload, restoring the apt file permissions back.</description></item></channel></rss>
