A classic debate that keeps erupting now and then is whether it&amp;rsquo;s ok or not to continue to look for other jobs after signing an employment contract with a company, to get potentially a better offer.
There are good arguments from both sides. Employers expect you to commit/be good to your word and not continue shopping around a signed offer letter. Candidates believe that this is unfair since companies typically have a much heavier side already in the employment power equation.</description><content>&lt;h2 id="1-what">1) What?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A classic debate that keeps erupting now and then is whether it&amp;rsquo;s ok or not to continue to look for other jobs after signing an employment contract with a company, to get potentially a better offer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are good arguments from both sides. Employers expect you to commit/be good to your word and not continue shopping around a signed offer letter. Candidates believe that this is unfair since companies typically have a much heavier side already in the employment power equation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Emotions (and tempers) run high every time this gets discussed, and there&amp;rsquo;s seemingly no possible consensus in sight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I posit that this is simply an optimization problem to be solved by everyone for themselves. The rest of my notes below dig into a bit more detail on the potential ways in which this could be navigated by a candidate as well as a hiring manager.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ground-truths">Ground Truths&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Before we begin, we will set forth a few facts, and a few assumptions that I believe are true, to form the ground for our aforementioned digging. I have tons of anecdotes from my experience screening 10s of thousands, interviewing 1000s, and hiring 100s of people, but I won&amp;rsquo;t list any of them here because, in a rational discussion, anecdotes serve only as bias and nothing else.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="facts">Facts&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A company, though seemingly a faceless entity, is not taking a hiring decision as one. It&amp;rsquo;s the hiring manager (and sometimes recruiters/HR) who are taking them, partly guided by their motivations and partly by the company&amp;rsquo;s practices&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In a country like India, every position gets hundreds, if not thousands or 10s of thousands of applicants&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The world is not perfect. Although we want an ideal state on the other side, that will only come in a piecemeal fashion, not everywhere&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An offer is an offer until accepted/signed. Then it becomes a &amp;ldquo;contract&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="assumptions">Assumptions&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Most people want to work with other people that they can trust&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most people want to optimize hiring for themselves (Candidates for their career, hiring managers for their own, companies for their profits)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="common-scenarios">Common scenarios&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It is assumed that the ideal state is where the below issues don&amp;rsquo;t happen.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Company&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Gives exploding offers (Accept/Reject in 1-2 days or the offer goes away)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Give out offers as an x% increment based on past compensation&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Candidate&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Wants another offer even after accepting one because
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>That will bring in another 10-20% hike&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Or they had to take a bad offer earlier (either much lower money than they are worth, or a company that they don&amp;rsquo;t really want to go to) because they were desperate and had no other choice&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="is-reneging-on-a-contract-bad">Is reneging on a contract bad?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The answer is &lt;strong>NO&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One would be naive to think of this in terms of good/bad because that&amp;rsquo;s not what matters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You may have a genuine reason, or you may have a completely frivolous reason to renege. The company may be a 10000 people/trillion$ behemoth barely impacted by a particular candidate&amp;rsquo;s decision or a barely surviving 2 people startup that will go under because of it. The outcomes may be wildly different depending on who&amp;rsquo;s on the other end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The real questions to ask are:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>1. Can there be trust in this relationship being built on top of a reneged contract?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The answer to this is the same as asking whether you can build a stable house on a shaky foundation. A house may still fall even if there were no apparent cracks in the foundation, but if you see visible cracks already you would think twice about building a house on top of it. This is true for any relationship whether friendship, love, or employment. You can choose to take a risk and turn out lucky, but many may be risk averse and avoid it (to their benefit or detriment ultimately, but that&amp;rsquo;s beside the fact).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2. Now that I know this, what should I do?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The answer is simple. &lt;strong>Optimize for yourself&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Implementation though, as usual, is much harder and one has to decide for themselves and their situation what they want to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An ideal hiring manager would optimize for the long term, purely on the skills of the candidate in their
An ideal candidate would optimize for their long-term career, choose a company that plays by the rules, treats their employees well, is fair in compensation at the hiring stage and later on&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The world is far from ideal though. An ideal hiring manager and an ideal candidate are hard to find and for good reason because both are burnt by bad experiences on the other side.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thus I don&amp;rsquo;t prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach and everyone chooses some shade of grey instead of being perfectly black or white. One can optimize for the short term or the long term, and optimize on different metrics, but always optimize knowing what you are optimizing for and what you are trading off against. Because if you don&amp;rsquo;t think of the complete picture, you run the risk of getting stuck in a local maxima.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="local-maxima-optimization-risks">Local maxima optimization risks&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>For Hiring Manager&lt;/strong>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Lose out on good candidates if you pass on candidates coming to you after reneging on a contract
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Typically not that big a problem for companies since there are many other good candidates to choose from&lt;/li>
&lt;li>However, there&amp;rsquo;s no guarantee that the candidates who didn&amp;rsquo;t renege on offers won&amp;rsquo;t just leave quite quickly after joining&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hire a fleeing candidate, if you choose to hire a candidate who reneged on another contract
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The candidate that you hired after they broke off their contract with another company, won&amp;rsquo;t they break yours right after they sign it&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>For Candidate&lt;/strong>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Lose out on good companies
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Typically a company/hiring manager that wants to do the right thing/be ideal, also expects the candidates to be ideal.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Get into a bad company
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A company that was willing to get you to break another contract for themselves, how empathetic would they be when it comes to breaking their contract with you?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As is usual, the risks for the candidate far outweigh those for the company, but such is life. Neither you/nor I can change this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But what this means is that if you feel that really had to sign a bad contract in desperation and surely need to go to a better company/offer, while knowing the risks, go for it. But if it&amp;rsquo;s because you just want to keep getting the highest bid on the market if it&amp;rsquo;s probably another 5/10% more, maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve given in to the greed a bit too much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Again, it&amp;rsquo;s for you to decide for yourself without caring about what the current/future hiring manager will think. Because irrespective of your circumstances, they&amp;rsquo;d form their opinion based on their own biases/experiences/policies and act accordingly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Similarly, ideally, a hiring manager would listen to every case, devote ample time to it understand the genuine reasons behind them, and take the candidates through. But the sheer glut of applications would mean it&amp;rsquo;s an easy optimization for a hiring manager to apply as a filter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll likely be crucified to say this, because no one wants to hear it. &lt;strong>The best optimization, with the least trade-offs, as a candidate is likely to build in that optionality for yourself. Where you are so good that you can take the liberty to say No to bad companies and bad offers.&lt;/strong> This isn&amp;rsquo;t always possible, but we can at least strive for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-i-dobelieve">What I do/believe&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note again, dear reader, that this is merely what I do or believe. I do not prescribe you to follow the same. Find your own optimization strategy.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="as-a-hiring-manager">As a hiring manager&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Be upfront and honest with the candidates about the compensation, the process, the hikes they can expect, and everything else, because a foundation built on trust lasts long&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make the team/company not only about the offer but strive to make it a place where people would want to join and stay&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Always make an offer in line with the range of that role
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Does not form a basis on previous compensation or other offers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fair to existing employees and all other hires as well since everyone remains on par&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ok with candidates in the interview process with multiple companies, have received other offers, want to use those offers to negotiate&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Never compare candidates, evaluate them in their absolute sense, and hire as soon as one meets the bar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Give reasonable time for candidates to accept offers
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Typically at least 1-2 weeks, but more if the candidate is waiting for other offers and is upfront about it&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the candidate has already signed a contract, then typically I&amp;rsquo;d want to avoid going forward with their candidature
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Unless they have a genuine reason not because of a meagre hike. But generally, the volume of applications and the inability to sufficiently distinguish genuine reasons from a lie serves as a detriment against going into the details of this for most cases&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I know the risks for me as a hiring manager that I outlined above, but I can choose to take those risks&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4 id="as-a-candidate">As a candidate&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Be upfront and honest with my potential employer(s), because a foundation built on trust lasts long&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If one does need to renege on a contract, communicate in time and honestly about it to avoid burning bridges&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Say NO, liberally. Many times when you think saying no means you will lose out results in either of these two scenarios:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The company was never worth it to work for anyways&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The company buckled in and towed your line&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="what-i-dont-dobelieve-inor-what-do-i-absolutely-detest">What I don&amp;rsquo;t do/believe in/or what do I absolutely detest&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Holding a grudge against someone who reneged on an offer (I&amp;rsquo;m actually happy if this happens because this reduces the chances of a much bigger burden on my team where someone joins and then quickly leaves because they already had one foot out the door)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Adding penalty clauses in contracts&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Blacklisting candidates/forming a cartel or cabal to share their names&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cooking up lies&lt;/li>

So, naturally I use headphones a lot, especially due to the video calls situation forced by the pandemic. Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve been having this uneasy feeling for a long time which is sort of like a headache but not really and it&amp;rsquo;s been gnawing at me. I attributed this to lack of sleep, stress, etc early on but then recently realized the main culprit for this is headphones that&amp;rsquo;s constantly keeping my ears busy. I used to use mostly IEMs for their better sound and isolation. Tried over the ears headphones but it didn&amp;rsquo;t really help much. People suggested using open back headphones and those helped but not much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Things got so bad that I felt irritated all the time and started dreading any calls as it seemed to not just cause me issues in ears/head but an overall fatigue. Then finally decided to completely let go of headphones but that meant I had to find appropriate replacements for my routine (noise-free calls, good enough music while working, good enough music while running/working out). After a lot of trial and error, have finally stumbled on to a setup that works out pretty great.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="hardware">Hardware&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>An old google home that was lying unused ever since I moved to the nest hub&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bone condution headsets (Aftershokz OpenMove. Wanted to buy the Aeropex but it seems to be out of stock everywhere)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Logitech C930e (for the microphone)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="conference-calls--meetings">Conference calls / Meetings&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Using Google home was a cinch for the incoming sound. Connected my laptop to the Google home via BT and the effect was immediately noticeable. First my ears didn&amp;rsquo;t feel any pressure at all, and they didn&amp;rsquo;t get hot as well like they used to earlier. Secondly, the voices were much heavier/bassy so that helped ease the load on my ears as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next challenge was the outgoing sound/microphone (since Google home mic cannot be used for calls via laptop) and to keep it sufficiently noise free. I decided to use the mic on my Logitech C930e for this. Now I&amp;rsquo;ve tried various microphones in the past including the ones on my headsets, the one in the laptop, and external ones like Blue Yeti and ATR2100USB and always came out unimpressed. The issues with them are that generally they are too sensitive and they pick up not just my voice but also any other sound nearby, or even the noises coming from outside my home office like kids shouting or a neighbor hammering away on their wall etc. ATR2100USB, being a dynamic mic with a helpful cardiod pattern, fairs better but I had to keep it quite close to me to be useful. The logitech C930 helps a lot with this. It has actually 2 microphones and both of them are unidirectional/cardioid. Using this, I figured out that it was able to easily get all of my voice easily recorded while not capturing any of the vocal or other sounds happening more than a few feet away from me. This coupled with the built-in noise cancellation capabilities of most meeting sofware of today (I tried Google meet, Zoom, Microsoft Teams), I could get perfect output. I was a little worried that the sound of others speaking during the call which was coming out of the google home will cause issues/feedback, but it seems that all the meeting software do a very good job of removing this and I did not face any issues of the output audio getting routed back to input. Couple of things I had to do to get the setup perfect were:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Select the &amp;ldquo;digital&amp;rdquo; interface device for the microphone of c930e (In archlinux/kde, this mic shows up with 2 entries one for analog and another for digital. The analog one captures all the unfiltered audio, including noise, just like other mics I tested while the digital one works better)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Had to set the gain of mic at ~90% in the settings to tailor it appropriately for my seating distance from the mic&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="listening-to-music-while-working">Listening to music while working&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I started using just Google home for this. Not only this serves my purpose well when I am listening to music exclusively (Google home has surprisingly good sound for its size), but even when I am working I can now listen to music witout getting distracted. I set the volume to 5% and it keeps playing in the background as a nice backdrop to my work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="listening-to-music-while-running">Listening to music while running&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This was the last issue for me as I really like music while running. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cruisemaniac">Ashwin&lt;/a> suggested to try out bone conduction headsets as he has been using these for a while. I was a bit skeptical at first but decided to give these a go. Researching on these I figured that Aftershokz Aeropex are the current state of the art/top of the line in this area but sadly they are nowhere to be found right now. Thankfully, they&amp;rsquo;ve launched the &amp;ldquo;Openmove&amp;rdquo; model recently which is supposed to be quite close to the aeropex in audio quality. I got these last week and have been using these during my runs. TBH, they aren&amp;rsquo;t anywhere close to the audio experience of an IEM but they are decent enough. A side bonus is that I have my ears open to the nearby sounds of traffic or any other things happening around me since I like to run in the open, not on a treadmill.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With these changes, I feel a lot more energetic through the day and feel that not just my ears but overall health has improved a lot.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Pradyumn's got a website</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2021/01/09/pradyumn-coding-website/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jan 2021 13:21:55 +0530</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2021/01/09/pradyumn-coding-website/</guid><description>My 10yo (Pradyumn) got interested in coding last year.

I wasn&amp;rsquo;t so sure about it in the beginning since I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to force my career choices or interests on to him. But I realized that he wanted to do it of his own accord, so I agreed to help him. But our deal was that I will introduce him a bit to the learning resources and help him out with his doubts here and there, while he will peruse all the learning material and build his things on his own without much interference/interaction with me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I took the regular path of introducing him to &lt;a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">scratch&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://code.org">code.org&lt;/a> initially, since that&amp;rsquo;s what I have seen being recommended for kids at many places. He got bored of them quite quickly though as he didn&amp;rsquo;t feel that he was coding enough, plus he felt limited in expressing himself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I then gave him a &lt;a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">python book&lt;/a> and he spent a couple of months learning that. He was quite into it and made few programs and games with the concepts he learnt from here. He felt quite happy with it except that he was mostly restricted to the command line programs. He found out about pygame and made a few graphical games which gave him a new high, but felt let down when he learnt he couldn&amp;rsquo;t share them easily with his friends and family since there was no easy packaging mechanism, plus a lot of the folks he wanted to share them with would just see it on the phone/tablets etc which won&amp;rsquo;t run python stuff anyways. He did find a few sites/programs that promised to translate these programs to mobile apps and all but they all seemed to have tricky corners to navigate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At this point, instead of having his time spent in packaging etc, I introduced him to the idea of learning HTML/CSS/Javascript. I myself don&amp;rsquo;t have much experience in the field of programming for the web, but I felt (and was instantly vindicated seeing his face light up) that this path will help achieve his goals and motivate him to keep learning. He researched about resources on this for a few days and asked me to buy him a couple of udemy courses which I did. He&amp;rsquo;s been going through this over the past month and made a couple of programs and a website to showcase them. As an aside, he also learnt a bit of git and github. I connected a domain to his github repository and here it is: &lt;a href="https://pradyumngoel.com/">https://pradyumngoel.com/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t really have any hopes/wishes linked to this, as I would fully support him to go into whichever field he likes. But the first step towards that is that the kids get to experience the various things that are available to them as choices. He&amp;rsquo;s been trying various sports and other activities in the past and I&amp;rsquo;m glad he is keen towards learning new things on his own and expanding his horizons.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Migrating my hugo blog from Gitlab/AWS S3 to Github Pages with Actions</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2020/01/05/migrate-hugo-blog-gitlab-s3-github-pages-actions/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jan 2020 16:25:46 +0530</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2020/01/05/migrate-hugo-blog-gitlab-s3-github-pages-actions/</guid><description>Until Now - The State of the union This blog is generated using hugo, an awesome static site generator.

&lt;p>This blog is generated using hugo, an awesome static site generator. So far, the workflow I used to deploy it was:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Push commit to the source repository on GitLab&lt;/li>
&lt;li>GitLab CI kicks off on receiving the push
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>CI downloads latest version of hugo and generates the static site&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Runs aws-cli to sync the new files to AWS S3&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>S3 serves the static site&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cloudflare provides:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>DNS services (so I can use &lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com">https://shantanugoel.com&lt;/a> without having to prefix it with a &lt;code>www&lt;/code>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>CDN/Caching services for resilience and keeping S3 bills low for data transfer&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="why-what-broke-the-camels-back">Why? What broke the camel&amp;rsquo;s back&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I was mostly happy with this setup with a couple of niggles at the back of my mind, vis. a vis.:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>aws s3 sync was finicky sometimes and sometimes, albeit rarely, the sync didn&amp;rsquo;t complete&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It took a long time to deploy a new update. Whenever I made a new post, it took around 5 minutes or more to appear due to issues stemming from GitLab CI taking time but mostly due to the time spent in s3 sync.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I also wanted to reduce the moving parts. I could have used GitLab pages but they&amp;rsquo;ve proved unreliable whenever I tried to use them&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the files ran into 10s of thousands, if I did lot of updates, I started running into incurring some cost due to S3 API usage. Especially because it was hard to upload only changed files. I tried few methods with hashes etc and it could be improved further but still I wanted to get rid of this issue.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Finally, the last push was announcement of &lt;a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions&lt;/a>. I had the itch, as usual, to try out the new and shiny, and so here we are.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="what-all-i-need-is-everything">What? All I need is everything&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>So, what I wanted to do was replace the source storage (GitLab to GitHub), CI (GitLab to GitHub Actions) and site host (AWS S3 to GitHub Pages). I kept Cloudflare&amp;rsquo;s DNS and CDN services as is because they are awesome, and I still want to continue to use the naked domain without &lt;code>www&lt;/code>.
Another thing I wanted while going this way was to keep the source repository and pages repository on GitHub separate because I want to be able to keep drafts in GitHub without having them available publicly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll see in the next section how all this was put together.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-lets-get-our-hands-dirty-shall-we">How? Let&amp;rsquo;s get our hands dirty, shall we!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The migration turned out to be pretty simple. This is how my setup looks like now:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Made a private source repository at GitHub, let&amp;rsquo;s call this &lt;code>shantanugoel.com-source&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This repository will be used to contain the website&amp;rsquo;s source&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Made another public repository which will contain our published site, e.g. &lt;a href="https://github.com/shantanugoel/shantanugoel.com">https://github.com/shantanugoel/shantanugoel.com&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Go to the settings section of this repository (e.g. &lt;a href="https://github.com/shantanugoel/shantanugoel.com/settings/">https://github.com/shantanugoel/shantanugoel.com/settings/&lt;/a> ) and set it to serve GitHub pages from the master branch&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Go to the Deploy Keys section of this repository (e.g. &lt;a href="https://github.com/shantanugoel/shantanugoel.com/settings/keys">https://github.com/shantanugoel/shantanugoel.com/settings/keys&lt;/a> ) and generate a deploy key with write access to the repository. Copy this key somewhere as you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to see this again.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Go to your source repository&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>Secrets&lt;/code> section (e.g. &lt;a href="https://github.com/shantanugoel/shantanugoel.com-source/settings/secrets">https://github.com/shantanugoel/shantanugoel.com-source/settings/secrets&lt;/a> ), and click on &amp;ldquo;Add a new secret&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Add a new secret named &lt;code>ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY&lt;/code> and set its value to the key that you copied in previous step.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This secret will be used in the action workflow that you&amp;rsquo;ll create in the next step.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Added a GitHub Action workflow specification to the repository at this location relative to root of repository &lt;code>.github/workflows/deploy.yml&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The filename can be anything ending in &lt;code>.yml&lt;/code> and written in YAML, but the directory path needs to be exactly as above.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The contents of the file are below. I&amp;rsquo;ve used comments in the contents to explain their usage.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Patterbuzz enables users to read premium content on their mobile devices and pay for only what they wish to read. So, If you wish to read only a cover story of a magazine, you do not need to buy a magazine for Rs 100/-. Instead,  you can pay Rs 5/- for only the cover story and read it on your iPAD in an rich and interactive way. this means Patterbuzz wants to unbundle content packaging and let users buy what they wish to. Patterbuzz introduces a digital wallet for the users to make purchases easier and in a pare-paid pay as you go model. In short, we want to be iTunes of publishing industry. This is a unique business model and we are the first ones in India (probably the world) to create this kind of platform for premium content publishing on mobile devices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We, at Patterbuzz, believe that there is huge premium quality indian content which is not easily available, especially in magazines and independent publications / writers which goes unnoticed in the whole world due to focus being majorly on US / UK markets. There is sizable indian/asian population outside india who wishes to read the magazines/independent content from India but they can&amp;rsquo;t find it on any platform. Apart from top Tier indian publications, 90% of the rest of indian publishers cannot reach global audience. Hence, with this background patterbuzz was created.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, Patterbuzz is trying to make content easily accessible to users in best way possible on mobile devices because that&amp;rsquo;s where users are reading more. Patterbuzz app does not just publish magazine PDFs like the rest of the world, they enable the regular print magazine content on digital format in an interactive way. And users can buy whatever they like. Patterbuzz is the only platform(as far as we know) offering unbundled content where a user can buy an individual article rather than purchasing an issue or subscribe to whole magazine. He can see a slideshow of images in an article or like, share and rate an article.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a huge roadmap in terms of features and more monetization options. We are looking forward to create a complete new kind of advertising offerings for premium content leveraging offline advertisement sales systems and apps on all other devices in the next 6-8 months timeframe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We already have 7 magazines on board as launch candidates and many other magazines are in pipeline. Our application just released a few days ago on 3rd Dec 2013 and we believe it will be great for us if you can review our app and let the world know if you like it.&lt;/p>

Blogs look for patents filed by companies and then report on each of them as if they are second coming of Jesus in technology. Especially if it is Apple who is doing the filings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few days ago, this &lt;a href="http://www.zdnet.com/apples-new-wave-anti-malware-patent-takes-a-leaf-out-of-qubes-book-7000011118/">new patent&lt;/a> showed up about Apple&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;new wave approach to fighting malware&amp;rdquo; with the author giving up half-researched commentary on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was intrigued by this news (if you can call it that), not because it’s something new but instead because process isolation is hardly a new concept. The author mentions &amp;ldquo;Qubes OS&amp;rdquo; as the one to be original inventor before Apple but in fact, it has been used for years (eg chrooting/containers in linux) and more popular recently in Android’s uid based approach. Even Qualcomm (and other SoC vendors) have stuff that helps in this space with Trustzone based isolation between processor entities at hardware level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, I wanted to check out what’s new here (which was not immediately clear and probably no one else tried to see it because the patent link is wrong in the article and it links to some display patent, not the one in question). The correct patent is this: &lt;a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/RE43987.html">http://www.freepatentsonline.com/RE43987.html&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After going through the mangled language that any patent embodies, it is clear that “conceptually” it is similar to what has been done till now, but the approach is different. On the whole, the basic difference seems to be that linux uses chrooting, android uses separate users, Qubes adds a virtualization layer to achieve the above and Apple goes one further (not necessarily better) and makes it real/physical separate processor instead of a virtual one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, I’m still not sold on this and it doesn’t seem foolproof. (I’m not a security expert by any means, so please take the below with a tablespoon full of salt and you are free to add corrections or throw me out the window ;) ) In fact, it doesn’t seem much better than the current system but has an add-on of cost (extra physical processor, dedicated circuitry/components) and losing ease of use. Some points to be noted:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The burden is still mostly on user. The user still needs to keep all his anti-malware programs updated all the time and be alert for each indication on the system and allow/disallow things to happen in system all the time to keep it protected. This approach is not going to save the system in any way if any of the above steps falter. Which is, pretty similar to what we see today.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The approach does not mention aversion of several crucial points:&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>a. If processor P2 itself is compromised by the malware, then it is rendered useless in the scenario where P2 itself is tasked with scanning the memory/files on Memory M2 for malware. It can be made to just report “all clean” by malware as the scanning engine running on P2 is still accessible by network content in the same way it would have been on P1 in a non-dual-processor system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>b. P2 is connected to the video display subsystem and this can be used to malware’s advantage to trick user into clicking on wrong areas or doing wrong things in the same way as it is today&lt;/p>
&lt;p>c. It says keypresses can be encrypted by P1 and decrypted by Network device 190 to allow P2 to not know what was pressed. But this again seems to not require the above approach. First, it requires a special network device now, not a generic one as mentioned in the patent. Second, since the network device itself needs to be configurable now for this, there is another attack vector there. This is, however, somewhat similar to what existing SoC solutions do in mobile space but that is better/feasible because the other end is a software entity and the mechanics of how it works is different.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>d. For online gaming etc, where the influx of data is huge and needs to be processed in real time, P1 takes this data directly from M2 once P2 signals availability. Not sure, how is this different then from having a single processor system without the above isolation?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>e. Several other things which I can keep typing about till my keys wear out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>TL;DR&lt;/strong>: This patent on its own may be a new idea (rather a new twist to an existing concept) but it is hardly something that can be put into practice and maybe the reason why Apple hasn’t actually produced anything with this, yet. It might become better with other ideas coupled (which Apple may have filed separate patents for but are currently unknown).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Aside: Why do patents cite archaic things? Every patent gives examples of some old stuff. E.g. Even though this patent was filed in 2011, it refers to Pentium 4 as an example of processors and Quake 3 Arena as an example of online games?&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Bugs: What you see is not always what it is</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2012/07/23/bugs-what-you-see-is-not-always-what-it-is/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jul 2012 04:46:08 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2012/07/23/bugs-what-you-see-is-not-always-what-it-is/</guid><description>Came across a neat nugget of historical information today that yet again proves that the software/hardware bug behavior that you may see on the surface might imply something totally opposite to what the problem actually is.

&lt;p>The &amp;ldquo;bug&amp;rdquo; existed back in the old times of the floppy drives. These drives seemed to fail very quickly on linux systems compared to MS DOS/Windows. Now, a normal observer would say linux had bad handling of the drives or was doing something messy that made these drives crap out ever so often. But as it turned out, the issue was the complete opposite. The real reason behind this problem was that linux was rock solid and stable compared to MS Dos.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Woah!! Hold on a minute, you say. How can being stable lead to hardware failure? Well, since DOS used to crash (or had to be rebooted) so often, it used to do a check on the floppy at boot up which used to shake up any dust on the drive. Since no such frequent reboots were required in linux, it caused a dust build up on the drive ultimately leading to it&amp;rsquo;s premature demise :(. Solution: A special program &amp;ldquo;diskseekd&amp;rdquo; whose sole purpose was to check the disk periodically to shake the dust out of the system and keep it happily working. Learned something nice today, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? :) Below is an excerpt frm the man page of diskseekd&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>In The Package&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The package included the following things:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The X-Mini Happy Capsule Speaker&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>USB Charging Cable&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>A soft cloth pouch for carrying&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>A set of earphones&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>User Manual&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Notes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The manual mentions that a microSD card should also be present but I didn&amp;rsquo;t find any in the box.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The USB charging cable comes with a 3.5mm cord attached to it as well. This led me to believe that it could be one of those charge and play type cable which could carry sound over it as well but that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the case and only the USB charging part was usable. Perhaps they bundled the cable from another one of their models which allows this.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Things I liked:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Inbuilt retractable 3.5 mm cord&lt;/strong>. Really loved this as I hate carrying so many cables with me while travelling. With this cable, you can easily connect it to any of your sound sources with a 3.5 mm slot (e.g. laptop/media player/phone etc) for instant sound gratification and then stow away the cable at the bottom when not needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Inbuilt SD card slot&lt;/strong>. You can insert an SD card filled with MP3s into this slot and play those songs from the speaker directly without needing any separate media player. This is an awesome feature. Playback controls are provided on the side and overlap with the volume controls. The speaker supports upto 8GB cards and you can copy songs to-and-fro from the card without removing it from the speakers. The supplied USB cable can also be used to access the speaker in mass storage mode to talk to the SD card.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Headphone out (or as they call it &amp;ldquo;BuddyJack&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/strong>. You can connect your headphones to the speaker and listen to songs. This port has three advantages. First is that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to fiddle with your laptop/media player&amp;rsquo;s port if you want to use your headphones for sometime instead of using these speakers. Second is that you can use this speaker as a media player itself by inserting an SD card into the speaker as listed above. Lastly, you can use this port to chain multiple X-Mini Happy speakers together in order to get louder output.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>InBuilt Rechargable Battery Pack&lt;/strong>. This is another good feature. Many of the portable speakers that I tried draw their power from the USB port. This is good enough to use with laptops but not for media players/phones. The X-Mini Happy speakers have built in rechargable batteries that can be charged from the USB port. The user manual states that the battery should run for around 5 hours when fully charged. In my testing, this was farely accurate and across multiple tests, they ran for around 4-5 hours in general with continuous playback.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>**- Sound Quality. **Volume wise, these speakers can get fairly loud. They were good enough to fill a fairly sized room and I was able to watch a movie by sitting at a diagonally opposite end (around 15 feet) without missing any dialogs. The speakers also had fairly good bass (low frequency) reproduction for their size. This could be due to their unique vacuum resonator (a rubbery tube like design which can be expanded when using the speakers and then compressed to save space while travelling). They were also ok in mid and high frequencies but the thing to be noted here is that for a portable speaker, they are better than anything I have come across so far.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure class="left" >
&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/x-mini-happy-capsule-speakers-package-contents-thumb.jpg" />
&lt;/figure>
&lt;figure class="left" >
&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/x-mini-happy-capsule-speaker-closed-thumb.jpg" />
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Drawbacks&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only drawback is that this is a single speaker unit so the sound output is monaural. This is also the reason that I prefer the X-Mini Max II capsule speakers more than this (review coming soon) although they don&amp;rsquo;t come with as many bells and whistles as the Happy capsule speakers. Apart from that, a minor niggle is that the supplied earphones could be better to round out the package.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Conclusion&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Are these speakers going to replace my full blown speaker set at home? No. But that is not the point. As a portable speaker, the X-mini Happy Capsule speaker packs a lot of punch while taking only a couple of inches and also playing double duty as a mp3/wma player that I&amp;rsquo;d pick it without a doubt.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>WordPress Global Dashboard &amp; Stats Plugin Problem</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/10/04/wordpress-global-dashboard-stats-plugin-problem/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2010 16:57:30 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/10/04/wordpress-global-dashboard-stats-plugin-problem/</guid><description>Seems like there is a major problem going on with WordPress.com and it&amp;rsquo;s stats plugin right now.

But like most other announcements of new things, this one was met as well with as much criticism as the praise it got.

I’ll try to address some of these concerns here to the best of my knowledge from what I’ve been reading over the past some time about this development.</description><content>&lt;p>An application review process was &lt;a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/2010/09/20/announcing-the-ubuntu-application-review-process/">announced today&lt;/a> for getting your apps into Ubuntu “extras” repository. But like most other announcements of new things, this one was met as well with as much criticism as the praise it got. A lot of the criticism is FUD though, although mostly unintentional and caused by ignorance of some facts behind it. I’ll try to address some of these concerns here to the best of my knowledge from what I’ve been reading over the past some time about this development.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before we begin, here are the terms listed out for an app to be eligible for the new repository:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>only new applications that are not present in an existing official Ubuntu repository (such as main/universe) are eligible in this process (e.g a new version of an application in an existing official repository is not eligible). Also no other software can depend on the application being submitted (e.g. development libraries are not eligible), only executable applications (and content that is part of them) are eligible, and not stand-alone content, documentation or media, and applications must be Open Source and available under an OSI approved license.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Now, the concerns that are floating around are many. Some are genuine queries and many are straight attacks dishing out evil conspiracy theories :P. The concerns can be summarised as:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Closed source and paid apps are being given the boot by Ubuntu. They should have allowed them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Why can’t we have updates for existing apps in this repository?&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Why only standalone apps are allowed. Libraries are equally important.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Why should the software be packaged for /opt. This involves more headache for the developers.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Standalone media and content should have been allowed.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Well, to answer these, all you need to understand is the “premise” and concept behind the repository where this software will go and the reasoning behind the review process will unfold itself. The repository governed by this review process is meant to be for “maintainable” pieces of software that would generally go to other universe/main etc repos but couldn’t make it into this release of Ubuntu because the developers were a bit late. This process and feature now gives a chance to the developers to still get their app to public instead of waiting for next release cycle and also allows end-users to use new apps without having to upgrade their version of Ubuntu . There is a separate “partners” repository where closed source and paid apps can go so there is no conflict there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Only allowing standalone apps and not updates and dependencies is so obvious. It would soon go out of hand exponentially if you allowed dependencies since one thing needs another library updated, then that would need another and yet another and so on and before you know it, you would be back at square one, that is upgrading to the next version of Ubuntu itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only thing that I found out of the place was not allowing standalone content but probably they didn’t allow it because such content can be had by end users without a repo easily and would ease the burden of repo maintainers and reviewers by lessening the entries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’d also like to point out that this is just a beginning and the process (and the people behind it) would definitely be maturing from all the feedback they get from the community. Think of it as an alpha release ;). Jono Bacon summed it up very nicely in this comment of his that he made elsewhere:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>this is an &lt;em>experimental&lt;/em> process; it is a work in progress, it will evolve, and the kinks will be ironed out. The process was approved by the Ubuntu Technical Board who are all seasoned Ubuntu developers (Matt Zimmerman, Colin Watson, Martin Pitt, Mark Shuttleworth, and Kees Cook), and much of what you refer to as &amp;ldquo;restrictions&amp;rdquo; were requested by them for the purpose of delivering a nimble process that is stable and secure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be clear: you can think of this process as a &amp;ldquo;light-weight&amp;rdquo; equivalent to our traditional MOTU development process; it is intended to provide a method in which app devs can get content in Ubuntu, whereas our traditional development processes have be orientated around the needs of Operating System integrators.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As such, this is a first step; sure it is not perfect, but I would like to invite you to make it better; I think this would be a more valuable contribution than just ranting about it on here. Our goal is to make Ubuntu better and to make it more attractive to app developers, and this process will evolve and improve (as was made clear throughout the discussion of this).&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So, what do you think about it? I, for one, am pretty excited..&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Acer TimelineX 4820TG Mini-Review</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/09/06/acer-timelinex-4820tg-review/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Sep 2010 12:18:12 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/09/06/acer-timelinex-4820tg-review/</guid><description>This is a small review of my Acer TimelineX 4820TG that I purchased a few days ago.

What I’ll concentrate more upon are the things that other reviewers don’t look at, or look at purely from numbers perspective which don’t make sense to an average buyer.</description><content>&lt;p>This is a small review of my Acer TimelineX 4820TG that I purchased a few days ago. Now, I won’t be talking numbers (like CPU/GPU performance etc) because these things are almost same as per the component used and have been covered in various other reviews online. What I’ll concentrate more upon are the things that other reviewers don’t look at, or look at purely from numbers perspective which don’t make sense to an average buyer. Please let me know if I miss something out that you want to know about this laptop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For clarification, I bought the topmost model of the TimelineX 14 incher series which has a core i5 430m with ATi 5650 1 GB graphics. (Other models have i3 only and one has 512mb graphics, while lowest end has only intel HD graphics). I bought it from Croma Retail for a price of 45,999 INR. So, here it goes:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Frame/Overall Build Quality&lt;/strong>: Overall, TimelineX 4820TG “feels” sturdy. It has a brushed metal lid and a plastic bottom. There is some flex all around, especially in the lid area but that is to be expected from a laptop which is so thin. For reference, I compared it to a lot of other laptops with almost similar dimensions, and the build quality and flex was generally on par with all of them, except the Asus Bamboo series and macbooks. I wouldn’t worry too much about it though. It is perfectly luggable through the campus or office, just that I wouldn’t keep anything heavy on top of it (I used to keep a lot of my books and other stuff on top of my previous laptop).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Keyboard&lt;/strong>: 4820TG’skeyboard is chiclet-type but it feels a bit flimsy as compared to the competition. It seems that the keys do not have support all arund but just at the center, so you can see the key edges tilting while typing. Also, the keys are not beveled but flat, which could put off few users though it was not a hindrance for me. Also, the keys feel just a tad bit mushy. But it takes just a few hours to get used to it. Only thing I’m not sure is whether I’ll still feel the same about this keyboard one year from now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Touchpad&lt;/strong>: The touchpad is awesome. It is fairly big compared to what others give you these days. It is also multi-touch and supports the usual gestures like two fingure scroll, pinch-zoom, rotate, etc and I guess you could extend these pretty easily by using appropriate software. The click buttons are rocker-type, i.e., a single bar serves as the two buttons depending on where you press. It’s ok but you have to be slightly more careful than having two separate buttons here as you have to press near the ends for the clicks to register properly. Though this also becomes a second nature after a few hours of use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Weight:&lt;/strong> The notebook is very light. I haven’t measured it on a weighing scale but for the oomph it packs, it is pretty slim and light. I can lift it easily by two fingers without feeling any strain and can work for hours with it sitting on my lap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Heat / Temperature / Noise:&lt;/strong> The heat and noise emission is very low. While browsing and downloading and doing other general stuff, I couldn hardly feel it heating up while on my laps. The left top area on the underside (just near the vents) becomes a bit warm after prolonged use but still it is not unconfortable. The keyboard and wrist/palm rest areas remain cool throughout. I could not hear the fans at all while doing normal work in the dead of night and this turns into a slight whirr when the laptop is tasked with heavier crunching.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Battery Life:&lt;/strong> This is the USP of this model and one of the biggest reason why I went for it. This laptop has switchable graphics, i.e., you can chose to use the onboard intel GMA HD graphics for regular use or multimedia playback (plays HD media beautifully) or switch to the ATi 5650 for heavier tasks like gaming, etc. While using the intel graphics, I could easily browse for around 5 hours. I also downloaded around 500mb of stuff during this time and another 300 mb worth of windows updates were downloaded and installed. Moreover, this was all on normal settings and that too when I had a very poor wi-fi signal. I hadn’t mucked around with any power saving options at all and I believe that doing that, along with dimming the brightness and better wi-fi signal etc would easily pump it over the 6 hour mark. This is not as much as the 8 hours that Acer promises but still, it is excellent and much better than most of the competition. While turning on ATi 5650 for the same type of tasks reduced the battery life to around 3 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Performance:&lt;/strong> I didn’t run any benchmarks on the laptop and neither did I do any gaming, but I didn’t feel any slow downs while doing any normal tasks and 720p/1080p media playback even while using the intel graphics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is it for now. I’ll keep updating it as more things come to my mind. I hope I have touched upon the significant aspects that I found missing when I was searching around for reviews of this laptop. Let me know if you have any queries for it and I’ll surely update it. Also, I haven’t gone into too much details as I’m primarily a linux user and haven’t explored or tasked this laptop too much till now. I’ll also be installing Ubuntu Maverick Meerkat on this asap and blog about this laptop’s linux compatibility, issues, fixes and workarounds as well.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Wi-Fi Keep Alive</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/06/28/wi-fi-keep-alive/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jun 2010 15:20:19 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2010/06/28/wi-fi-keep-alive/</guid><description>UPDATE Potential work arounds for folks having problem in sleep policies not working correctly have been put in version 1.2.0 onwards.

Are you frustrated by your downloads getting broken or worse, switching over to slow and expensive mobile data connections like GPRS/Edge/3G when your wi-fi connection gets dropped by your Android phone when the screen goes off?</description><content>&lt;p>&lt;strong>UPDATE&lt;/strong> Potential work arounds for folks having problem in sleep policies not working correctly have been put in version 1.2.0 onwards. Please redownload to test and let me know. Read below for more details.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Latest Version:&lt;/strong> 1.4.4 (See below for change log history)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Are you frustrated by your downloads getting broken or worse, switching over to slow and expensive mobile data connections like GPRS/Edge/3G when your wi-fi connection gets dropped by your Android phone when the screen goes off? If yes, then look no further. Here is my app that allows you to choose your desired Wi-Fi Sleep policy. You can choose from the following options:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Default -&amp;gt; This means that wi-fi will turn off whenever the screen goes off.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Wi-Fi On on sleep if plugged -&amp;gt; This means that if your phone is plugged into a USB slot or wall charger, then wi-fi will not turn off even when the screen goes off.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Wi-Fi Never goes off -&amp;gt; This means that your wi-fi will not shut down whenever screen turns off, even if you are not plugged into USB/charger.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Please note that this app just changes the sleep policy and does not change the wi-fi state by itself. You can still control wi-fi turning on/off manually.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Few folks were having issues with their devices that the inbuilt handling of this wi-fi sleep policy in their phones wasn&amp;rsquo;t being done properly by Android. To take care of this, there are a few workarounds added to the app now which can be accessed by clicking on &amp;ldquo;Advanced Options&amp;rdquo; on the configuration screen (This configuration screen can be accessed by launching the app or it will also show up whenever you add a widget). Enable any one or all of the workarounds mentioned in advanced settings depending on what works best on your device as there are lot of variants due to different manufacturers and different Android versions on different phones. Please also note that you should enable these workarounds only if the app is not working fully well for you without enabling them as some of them can cause your battery to drain a bit faster.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another thing to note is that I&amp;rsquo;ve added a widget for it. So, you can install the app and instead of having to open the app and change the setting every time, you can just add its widget to your home screen (Long press on home screen. Then choose Widgets-&amp;gt;Wi-Fi Keep Alive). Now, you can just touch it whenever you want to change your setting and it will automatically cycle through the options listed above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dark/Sepia Widget Icon -&amp;gt; Default setting&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Purple Widget Icon -&amp;gt; Wi-Fi On on sleep if plugged&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Green Widget -&amp;gt; Wi-Fi never goes off&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please try it out and let me know if you face any issues or have any suggestions :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Known Issues:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>1) Known issue with &amp;ldquo;on when plugged in&amp;rdquo; policy is that if you are already plugged in while changing anything in the app, workarounds don&amp;rsquo;t take place until you plug out and plug in again&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**2) **This is not a known issue with the app but with wi-fi on some devices itself that it stops working on leaving it idle even if the phone is not sleeping. This is not the purview of this particular app and it might not solve it, although few folks say that this app helps in this scenario as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**3) **Some routers/settings are also known to cause issues with wi-fi in sleep. The correct pattern has not been identified yet but many people report that they can stay connected to wi-fi in sleep with some routers but with other routers, it fails. (Work Around 3 might help in such cases but not always)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**4) **While adding widget, the main app screen will pop-up for widget configuration. You need to choose any one policy (even if desired one already selected) otherwise widget will not be added&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Notes:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**1) **Please press Menu key in the app and select &amp;ldquo;Help&amp;rdquo; to see details about policy and workaround options.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**2) **Please report any bugs here along with these details so that i can fix the issues:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i) Device/Phone Name and Rom version&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ii) What is the app version that you have? (latest is 1.2.1)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>iii) Did you try turning on all combinations of workarounds in advanced options?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>iv) Can you please enable logging in the advanced options and send me logcat dump for this duration, preferably with all workarounds enabled.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You are free to download, install, modify and use this script for any commercial/non-commercial purposes. However, if you modify the script and/or re-distribute it, I’d like to request you to keep the attribution to me as the author intact in the script as well as provide a credit/linkback to this page in associated files/webpages etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>I’d also be happy if you can send me your modifications to fix any bugs or add new features and would be glad to incorporate them and host them here if you want.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can also send in any bug reports or feature requests by posting a comment below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Requirements:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.perl.org/get.html">Perl&lt;/a> (Tested on v5.6.1 and v5.10. If you have linux, this might already be installed. For Windows, please click on the link.)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/download.html">gnuplot&lt;/a> (Tested with v 4.2.6)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Installation:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Install the above mentioned requirements&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Make sure that you can run “perl” and “gnuplot” commands (“pgnuplot” instead of “gnuplot” if you have windows) in your shell/command prompt. If you see an issue, add the path to the executables for these to your environment variables.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Download the below linked zip file and unzip it to any location (preferably to a place where you have write permissions as a normal user).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Usage:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The script is named rtgnuplotter.pl. The various details regarding its usage are as below:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Input Parameters:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>-xrange min:max (Optional) Horizantal Range
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>-yrange min:max (Optional) Vertical Range
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>-invertx        (Optional) Invert horizontal Axis
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>-inverty        (Optional) Invert Vertical Axis
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>-hex            (Optional) Input data is in hex (without leading 0x)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>-joindots       (Optional) Data points are connected with lines
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>-h\\-help\\-v     (Optional) Print usage and version info&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Input Data: The input data for rtgnuplotter is expected to be two space separated numbers, the first number being for x axis and second for y axis. Each set of coordinates denoting a point to be plotted should be on a new line. Hexadecimal as well as decimal numbers are supported. For Hexadecimal input, use the “-hex” option but the numbers should not have “0x” prefix.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Usage: All the options for rtgnuplotter are optional. You can run it with/without any options and it will wait for you to provide input on standard input. You can also pipe data into the script from another program using “|”. Few examples of the usage are:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>perl rtgnuplotter.pl
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>tail -f mydata.log | grep --line-buffered “Data Points” | sed --unbuffered ‘s/.*x=\([0-9.-]*\).*y=\([0-9.-]*\).*/\1 \2/&amp;#39; | perl rtgnuplotter.pl&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>In the second example above, we get the data being written to a logfile by some other program, grep for the lines that have our points, then extract just the numbers with sed and then pass them to rtgnuplotter. Please note that “&amp;ndash;line-buffered” and “&amp;ndash;unbuffered” options used with grep and sed respectively, are important, otherwise you might not see your data being plotted immediately.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The zip file also contains a test file “inp.pl” that you can use to test the script. inp.pl generates some random numbers To run the test, just cd to the place where you unzipped the file and run the command line given in 2nd example in one command window and “perl inp.pl &amp;gt; temp.txt” in another.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Lost the files in a server move and not available anymore&lt;/em>&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Paradise For Overclockers, Gamers and PC Enthusiasts In India</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/12/07/overclockers-pc-enthusiasts-gamers-india/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2009 18:05:27 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/12/07/overclockers-pc-enthusiasts-gamers-india/</guid><description>This is just to let you know that a few of my friends have started Overclocked, a haven for PC enthusiasts in India.

Killzone 2 is a very different game as compared to the other run-of-the-mill FPS&amp;rsquo;s out there. Now, I might not be the best player out there but I&amp;rsquo;ve played my fair share of it. So, I thought of jotting down some quick points for the different classes, how to play them and how to make the most of them according to my opinion. I hope to make this a series where I would discuss the strategies for a class and its primary and secondary abilities and once all classes are covered, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably touch upon the rest of the aspects of the game. Please read them and supplement them with real practice to see the benefits. And yeah, do not hesitate to point out the flaws if any and I&amp;rsquo;d also love to hear about the tactics that you follow as well as KZ2 is a game where the element of surprise is very important which calls for unusual strategies many times ;).&lt;br>
So without wasting any more time, here is a really really basic set that you should follow:&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>**Engineer&amp;rsquo;s Prime Role: **Understand that your role is not that of a front line assault. An engineer is best suited as a defender or a support class.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Engineer&amp;rsquo;s Weapon - Shotgun&lt;/strong>: The shotgun is called the one shot killer. It fires a burst of various pellets resulting in a much larger hit area and so you need not be extremely accurate. But it has some salient points to be noted while using it.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Shotgun is useful only in a very short range. Avoid long range combat because 99% you will find yourself dead without even getting a single hit point at the opponent. This means lurk around in corners or alleyways, take the less travelled routes to your destinations, and let your turrets do the most of your job for you&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shotgun is slightly heavy as compared to other weapons and hence you will find yourself moving that right analog stick quite a bit more for aiming.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shotgun has a high reload time between bullets and especially the full magazine. So if you are in middle of a fight and run out of a mag, it&amp;rsquo;s best to take out your M4 revolver instead of waiting to reload (or just run away if you are not confident enough of your revolver or haven&amp;rsquo;t unlocked it yet)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Engineer&amp;rsquo;s Primary Ability - Turrets&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Find elevated places. It has two advantages. First, it is more difficult for the opposition to take it out because it is above the eye level and second, your turret has more chances of getting headshots leading to faster kills and more points.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cover up alleyways/alternate routes which the enemy can take to flank your team. This is more important than you think. You are, in effect, forcing the opposition to take a route where most of your team mates can easily take them down.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t place them close to walls as it makes them more susceptible to damage.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t bunch up your turrets, keep them a safe distance apart. This has two advantages. First, it is more difficult for the enemy to take out your turrets (otherwise they can take them out together easily), plus each turret can give cover to the other and also attack the enemy from two sides taking him down quickly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For rounds like Search &amp;amp; Destroy/ Defend or assassination, don&amp;rsquo;t place turrets very close to the objective point but at a slight distance, at a place where the turret has clear line of sight to the objective point and/or the path to it. This will make it safe from the enemy while raining hell onto him while he is concentrating somewhere else.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Engineer&amp;rsquo;s Secondary Ability - Repair&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Repair ability is a very underrated ability. It might not give you a hell lot of points by itself but it is very important for your team.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Repairing ammo crates is a natural thing as your team mates might need it but that is not the most important thing to concentrate upon as people might not need them too often as people die often in KZ2 and moreover they might not want to waste time taking stuff out of the crate and risking their life.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>First important use of repair ability is to repair your own turrets. Your turrets go under wear and tear as time progresses or when attacked by someone. It is of utmost importance to keep repairing them because you have to wait for a lot of time before you can set up another turret while repair ability recharges much faster.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Second is to repair the emplaced/mounted machine guns at various places in the maps. Repair them and use them to take down the enemy quickly (especially useful for S&amp;amp;D). But make sure that another guy/turret is protecting you from out of peripheral-view attacks.
So that&amp;rsquo;s it for now. But keep in mind that just reading these tips won&amp;rsquo;t help unless you **practice. **Let me know if you found these tips helpful or if you have any map/situation specific queries and if you would like to add your own strategies. I&amp;rsquo;ll take up a new class next time.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></content></item><item><title>VirtualBox High CPU Usage Problem Solved</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/07/07/virtualbox-high-cpu-usage-problem-solved/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jul 2009 03:36:00 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/07/07/virtualbox-high-cpu-usage-problem-solved/</guid><description>A few days ago, I had to install Windows XP as a guest OS on my Ubuntu Hardy machine as I needed to carry out some Visual Studio work.

What I noticed was that my CPU usage went through the roof (constantly at 100%) even if the guest was completely idle. Result: My laptop was shutting down within a few minutes because the CPU was heating up and its temperature going beyond 75C. And finally came to know a simple solution from a friend, that immediately worked. The solution was to create a new dummy guest machine in VirtualBox, allocate minimal RAM to it (I gave 4MB) and just run it, don’t even need to add boot disk to it and to my surprise, the CPU usage came down to just 3-4% immediately. I’m not sure why this issue is happening and how the dummy machine solved it but atleast it is working for me now. If you have a similar issue, you can try out the same.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Opera Web Server In A Browser: Bad Idea</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/06/17/opera-web-server-browser-bad-idea/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jun 2009 08:17:04 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/06/17/opera-web-server-browser-bad-idea/</guid><description>Today, the whole word is going gaga over &amp;ldquo;Opera Unite&amp;rdquo;, the new technology in Opera 10 which will make your web browser a web server as well (and not just that, it will make a whole lot of “sharing” options available).

As soon as there was an outage, it couldn’t stop the PS3 from an abrupt shut down. I ran around the pathetic Microtek customer service for days and they finally sent an “engineer” down to my place (after a week) to diagnose the issue and he couldn’t say anything more than that the UPS is meant for a PC and nothing else.</description><content>&lt;p>I got myself a &lt;strong>Microtek 800VA UPS (MDP800+)&lt;/strong> a couple of weeks ago to save my PS3 from the frequent power outages that we are seeing in Hyderabad but the purpose was rather lost when I found that it worked fine only till the mains power was on. As soon as there was an outage, it couldn’t stop the PS3 from an abrupt shut down. I ran around the pathetic Microtek customer service for days and they finally sent an “engineer” down to my place (after a week) to diagnose the issue and he couldn’t say anything more than that the UPS is meant for a PC and nothing else. All logical discussions to tell him that PS3 is essentially a PC but in a different form were kind of like pouring water on a well-oiled rock and hoping it would stick.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kind of disappointed, I had a hunch which solved it for me though today :). When I tried to read the output voltage from the output ports on the UPS, it showed me 225–230V when main supply was on. As soon as it was switched off, the output dropped to around 160V. On connecting the PS3, it went up a bit (to around 180V). Now, the load should not have been an issue because a PS3 requires 180–350W I think, which can easily be given by even a 500VA UPS. So far, all suggestions given to me were to remove everything else from the UPS except the PS3, but that was actually my setup in the very first place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The weird idea that I had was that the problem is, in fact, that the PS3 is not enough load for it. Call me crazy but as soon as I connected my TV also to the UPS, it started working just fine and dandy. No trip ups now, and I can even cold-boot my PS3 and TV from the UPS backup alone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, I ain’t the sharpest tool in the shed when it comes to electrical stuff (in fact this was one of my most dreaded subjects during my graduation). So, if anyone can give me a sound reasoning behind what I just saw would be very much appreciated. Or is this a real fault with the unit that I got, or maybe it is a defect in all the Microtek UPS’s? Anyways, I ain’t complaining till it’s working for me :) and if you are seeing the same issues you could try the same as well.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Why You Should Not Upgrade to Ubuntu Jaunty Jackalope (9.04)</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/05/04/ubuntu-904-jaunty-jackalope-upgrade-graphics-problem/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 May 2009 17:46:40 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/05/04/ubuntu-904-jaunty-jackalope-upgrade-graphics-problem/</guid><description>Update: It has come to my notice that many people do not know about this (and other problems listed in comments of this post).

&lt;p>You should not upgrade to Ubuntu 9.04 (aka Jaunty Jackalope), released a few weeks ago, if:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You have an older ATI graphics card (prior to R500, .e.g xpress 200m)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You like to have 3D support (read compiz/games, etc)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This is because of the following reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Ubuntu Jaunty Jackalope has the new version of X.org server (1.6)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The open source graphics drivers for ATI do not have 3D support&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The only version of the ATI properietary drivers (fglrx\Catalyst) compatible with X.org server 1.6 is 9.4&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Support for older cards (mentioned above) was dropped from fglrx 9.4&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So, basically right now you are in a soup and it seems to me that this is going to remain this way unless someone figures out how to backport x.org 1.5 onto Jauntu, which is going to be a hell of a task, IMHO :P&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, if you are a simple person, who looks beyond the gloss of the 3D and marvels at the beauty that the rest of the system holds, then go right ahead and dive in :)&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Figlet Online</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/03/22/figlet-online/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Mar 2009 14:15:54 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/03/22/figlet-online/</guid><description/><content/></item><item><title>Comments In Google Reader Shared Items Are Here</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/03/12/google-reader-shared-items-comments/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2009 05:00:22 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2009/03/12/google-reader-shared-items-comments/</guid><description>Since quite some time, Google Reader has included the feature to share interesting items with your friends who also use Google Reader.

&lt;p>Another way was to keep sharing the item again and again with your own notes, but that would really become a pain (as you can imagine where).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, google listened to my unspoken thoughts and from this morning onwards, we have a new commenting feature on shared items. Click on the pic below to see it. So, they have given an alternate commenting system that you can use in your friend circle to discuss any item. Really cool, I&amp;rsquo;d say. What do you think?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Good exposure to a wide audience without spending a dime. yes, all listings are free, even for paid apps.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Payments can be taken through Google Checkout or your own payment gateway&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Certainly a good initiative by Google. Some of the good apps I found are (all free ones, since I’m a cheapskate :D ): &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/enterprise/marketplace/viewListing?productListingId=5143210+6352879591152674960">Google Short Links&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/enterprise/marketplace/viewListing?productListingId=4147159+11927776548951023888">Gmail Backup&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/enterprise/marketplace/viewListing?productListingId=3538797+14883126272580344305">Google Email Uploader&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/enterprise/marketplace/viewListing?productListingId=4915422+2675796265305842710">LuckyCal&lt;/a>, etc.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Now, I just caught another conflict between google and adsense on my own blog. Basically, Google is against TLAs (text-link-ads) since they mess up the search engine rankings and even penalizes any site that sells or buys them. But look what I found in one of the ads displayed in google.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I guess this is a reason for us to rejoice because of two reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>This would definitely make life that much more better as the open source developers fix these particular drivers (ALSA people, start your engines)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>This also means another big inroads into the commercial world for open source as creative is definitely one of the big boys around.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Now, I wish NVidia would see the light of the day as well.

But definitely not, if you follow this advise.

This could occur when someone linking to your website or typing in his browser address bar mistypes a url, or maybe that page has been moved or deleted by you. Lost opportunity? Maybe. But definitely not, if you follow this advise. Many people don’t have a 404 page altogether, a few implement with an inane message like “Something went wrong”, a few will try to help out the seemingly lost user  by giving a few navigation options linking to home page, archives or most popular posts, etc. Definitely the last option among these is quite good to retain the users, but we’ll go one step ahead and turn this into an extra source of cash.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note: This is perfectly fine according to Google Adsense TOS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What we’ll do is implment a search box (Adsense For Search) on the 404 error page, which will net us the following benefits:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Give the users a way to search for what they would have come looking for and hence retain them on your website.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Make money if they click on any ads that are shown by Adsense for search.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now we’ll see how to do it for a wordpress blog as well as a static site.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-to-implement-google-adsense-for-search-for-your-blog">How to implement google adsense for search for your blog:&lt;/h3>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>**Common step: **The first step for independent of what kind of site you have, is to sign up for &lt;a href="http://google.com/adsense/">Google Adsense Publisher Account&lt;/a>. Once you have signed up, log on to your account and go to Adsense Setup -&amp;gt; Get Ads -&amp;gt; Adsense For Search. Customize the box according to your need. (Select the “Open search results in my website” option to make sure users remain on your site. And insert a url where you’d like to show the results. e.g. mine is &lt;a href="http://tech.shantanugoel.com/search/">http://tech.shantanugoel.com/search/&lt;/a> ). Once you are done, you will get two snippets of code. One for displaying the search box and another for displaying the search results. Lets call them “Adsense-For-Search-Box-Code” and “Adsense-For-Search-Results-Code”. We’ll use them below for our implmentation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>For a static site:&lt;/strong> A static site is one where you have static/hand-coded html pages (i.e., not generated by a server side language, e.g. PHP). This requires 3 steps now:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step 1) Create a 404.html page that will contain your search box code and will be displayed in case of a 404 error. A simple sample implmentation would be a blank page that contains just the search box code. The contents of this page can be as shown below:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Step 2) Create a search-results.html page that will contain the search results (You need to enter http://&amp;gt;your-domain-name&amp;lt;/search-result.html in the adsense settings for this). Here, also you can either create a blank html page with just the search results code added or mimic the look of your website. Possible Contents:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Step 3) Modify your .htaccess file to add the following line:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And you are done. For a wordpress site, read on:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>For a WordPress based site/blog:&lt;/strong> For a wordpress based site, you don’t have to modify the .htaccess. The 3 steps you have to follow are as below:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step 1) Create or modify your 404.php file (generally in your theme’s root directory, e.g. http://&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->/wp-content/themes/&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->/404.php ) to include the adsense for search box code. e.g.:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&amp;lt;?php get_header(); ?&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&amp;lt;div id=&amp;#34;content&amp;#34;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&amp;#34;Adsense-For-Search-Box-Code&amp;#34;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&amp;lt;?php get_footer(); ?&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Step 2) Create a search-results.php file (generally in your theme’s root directory, e.g. &lt;code>http://&amp;lt;your-site-name&amp;gt;/wp-content/themes/&amp;lt;your-theme&amp;gt;/search-results.php&lt;/code>) to include the adsense for search results code. e.g.:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&amp;lt;?php
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>/*
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Template Name: Google Adsense Search Results
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>*/
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>?&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&amp;lt;?php get_header(); ?&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&amp;lt;div id=&amp;#34;content&amp;#34;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&amp;#34;Adsense-For-Search-Results-Code&amp;#34;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&amp;lt;?php get_footer(); ?&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Step 3) Login to your WordPress dashboard, go to Write-&amp;gt;Page. Create a new page with its url/slug being &lt;a href="http://%3Cyour-site-name%3E/search">http://&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->/search&lt;/a> (e.g. &lt;a href="http://tech.shantanugoel.com/search">http://tech.shantanugoel.com/search&lt;/a> ) or whatever that you input in your adsense settings. Make sure you select the page template as “Google Adsense Search Results” as we had mentioned in the search-results.php file at the top. Save this page and you are done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, try to go to any non-existent url on your site (You can try this with this blog also, appending any weird url after &lt;a href="http://tech.shantanugoel.com/">http://tech.shantanugoel.com/&lt;/a> ) and you will be presented with the nice adsense-for search box. Let me know if this helped you out or you find any shortcomings in this or have any of your own tips. Also let me know if you need my specific 404.php and search-results.php files.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Save Your Adsense Account: Put Up That Privacy Policy</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/11/04/save-your-adsense-account-put-up-that-privacy-policy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2008 17:35:58 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/11/04/save-your-adsense-account-put-up-that-privacy-policy/</guid><description>Google is known to be pretty strict with making sure that all Adsense publishers remain conformant to their policies.

&lt;p>Now why I wrote this post was that though almost every site I visit has adsense ads, but only a very miniscule fraction of them is abiding with this condition. Maybe they don’t know this because on my search, I came to know that this clause was added to google’s policy around March this year. I don’t know how much fuss is google is going to create over this but I’d rather be safe than sorry. Especially when it takes only a few minutes to create your privacy policy. To create yours with a few clicks, I came across a simple online template here: &lt;a href="http://www.serprank.com/privacy-policy-generator/index.php">Adsense Privacy Policy Generator&lt;/a>.

Essentially, they are aiming to mandate a passing of &amp;ldquo;machine-or-transformation test&amp;rdquo; as a pre-requisite for granting a patent.

This means that a mere &amp;ldquo;idea in my head&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t qualify for a patent until it is put into practice on a machine or can transform the state of an object for a specific purpose. Am no lawyer but what the experts are making out from the long judgement is that many industries will be hit hard by this ruling. Especially software companies who own most of the software patents as business practices, and a majority of these would be found unworthy of patents as they would be found too generic and stifling for the growth of industry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, companies like Microsoft would have a lot to rue about as a huge portion of their patent portfolio has become circumspect. This not only would rob them of revenues in terms of royalties but would also open up a lot of space for competition as well. Special thanks to Red Hat to take up the fight and providing crucial data to the court to take this decision. Stallman and FSF would be very happy today :)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I had this experience with my webhost just a couple of days back. My site was being hammered by 100s and 1000s of visitors from stumbleupon, digg, linux.com, linuxtoday, lxer, lifehacker, etc all at the same time. Needless to say I ran out of my 15 GB monthly bandwidth in no time. So many visitors coming but finding a mundane “509 Bandwidth exceeded” error. Alas!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I mailed my host that I was willing to pay a bit more to get some more bandwidth per month so that this doesnt occur in the future. I woke up in the morning and found a one-liner reply in my box that made my day “&lt;strong>Increased monthly limit to 20 GB”. Without any charge.&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>Even though I was willing to pay&lt;/strong> and  had told them so. And already I’m paying a very measly amount for my hosting (20$ per year) so they are not retaining a BIG customer as well. I’m just a tiny fish. If that is not the sign of a good webhost then I don’t know what is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You must be curious who my webhost is (those of you already haven’t whois’ed it). Well, the host is &lt;a href="http://www.rvh.in/billing/aff.php?aff=021">Real Value Hosting&lt;/a>. Do visit them. We need to have more hosters like them.&lt;/p>

So I fired up pidgin within my virtual box installation at work (as I have only a 64 bit machine at home) but couldn&amp;rsquo;t get it to connect.

So I fired up pidgin within my virtual box installation at work (as I have only a 64 bit machine at home) but couldn&amp;rsquo;t get it to connect. Tried all sorts of methods found over the net of changing ports etc, set port forwarding in Virtual Box NAT, even switched to using a bridged host interface but still no go. On a whim, installed pidgin in the host, i.e., windows and still the same issue. Hmm, interesting.. But wait, gtalk client works, then what gives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, after a bit of snooping around, discovered that it&amp;rsquo;s a special funda that my company employs (and probably yours too) to monitor your IM conversations. The server talk.google.com was redirected to another server set up by my company that masquerades as gtalk server and tries to act as a &amp;ldquo;Man In The Middle&amp;rdquo; to hijack your connection and listen to everything while you live in the fantasy that since its an &amp;ldquo;SSL encrypted&amp;rdquo; connection, everything is secure. However, &amp;ldquo;fortunately&amp;rdquo; pidgin refuses to connect here (More details in the end)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But as they say, rules are meant to be bent and broken. Here, is a simple way 3-step procedure to circumvent around this.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Open up your gtalk account settings in pidgin and go to Advanced tab.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Check &amp;ldquo;Force old port&amp;rdquo;, uncheck &amp;ldquo;plaintext auth&amp;rdquo; and uncheck &amp;ldquo;Require SSL/TLS&amp;rdquo;. Also change &amp;ldquo;Connect port&amp;rdquo; to 443.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>main&lt;/strong> part: Go to an online nslookup service and do an nslookup for talk.google.com. Put the IP that you get in place of &amp;ldquo;talk.google.com&amp;rdquo; in the settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s it. Go and chat away. (or if you want to know the reasoning behind this, hit the link below)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>More Details:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Skip this if you want, only for the people who are interested, here are some details on why pidgin does not connect in this situation and how you can find out if your company is using this tactic.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>How pidgin tries to connect to gtalk servers is that first it makes a connection to talk.google.com and gets and verifies the certificate from there. Then it tries to connect to gmail.com. Now there can be various situations:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>1.
1. Its unable to complete the transaction in the first place because you didn't use the port 443, so firewall blocks it hence it can't communand tries to fallback to plaintext authorization which is not supported by google and hence it fails.
2. You chose correct settings to go around firewall but now after verifying certificate, it just keeps &amp;quot;connecting&amp;quot;. Basically, it passes through the talk.google.com phase and then tries to connect to gmail.com (don't know why) and gets stuck on this step because the company is masquerading the gtalk server but not the gmail server.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>Look for the following symptoms to see if your company is doing &amp;ldquo;something&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>1.
1. Do &amp;quot;nslookup talk.google.com&amp;quot; in your command prompt (not through web), then say you get an IP x.y.z.w. Now do &amp;quot;nslookup x.y.z.w&amp;quot; again in command prompt. Now you will get the real name of the server that is your company's. Can try this for other IM servers as well (e.g. yahoo)
2. When pidgin asks you to verify the certificate, don't take it lightly. Just fetch and see the certificate and it'll definitely be pointing to some other domain.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Enough fundas for today. Let me know if this helped you out or if you have your own techniques of finding and circumventing around such stuff.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Apology For Bad Downloads</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/09/05/apology-for-bad-downloads/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2008 16:13:19 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/09/05/apology-for-bad-downloads/</guid><description>Guys, for the past few days if you downloaded any &amp;ldquo;.tar.gz&amp;rdquo; packages from this site (like my splert or shantz-xwinwrap tools), then you&amp;rsquo;d have got a corrupt package.

But only one version of this app was ever released, and it had a few problems, like:

&lt;p>Well, sticking didn&amp;rsquo;t work. So if you did a &amp;ldquo;minimize all&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;go to desktop&amp;rdquo; kind of thing, your &amp;ldquo;wallpaper&amp;rdquo; got minimized as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The geometry option didn&amp;rsquo;t work, so you could not create, e.g., a small matrix window surrounded by your original wallpaper.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Seeing no-one picking it up, I decided to give it a bit of polish last weekend by fixing the above problems and also add a few features. And here it is, in its new avatar &amp;ldquo;Shantz XWinWrap&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Video:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Usage&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The download file above contains 32 bit as well as 64 bit binaries. (Deb packages for ubuntu/debian are also included in the same file)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Though a lot of options are shown below, the only ones you&amp;rsquo;d most likely need are &amp;ldquo;fs&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;g&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;ov&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sh&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The modified source code can be browsed/downloaded from the &lt;a href="https://launchpad.net/xwinwrap">Shantz XWinWrap Launchpad Bzr repository&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>iPhone&lt;/strong>: The big icon. Bharti Airtel/Vodafone claimed lakhs of pre-registrations, yet no one lined up to buy it. Anyways, to the point. The ads all over the print, digital and broadcast media in India list out 3 major points in one sentence:&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>1. **A 3G Phone:** My a$$. They haven't even finalized auction details for 3G spectrum in India yet.
2. **Desktop Class Browser:** Without Flash?
3. **Push E-mail:** Oh, the one that Apple already pulled the plug on?
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Anyways, even if this were to be true, nobody would have bought it for the steep price for something that hardly even performs properly as a phone.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>BIG TV&lt;/strong>: This is the &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; big one, from the stable of none other than Reliance/Anil Dhirubhai Ambani. Ok, it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be good, very good. I checked out &lt;a href="http://bigtv.co.in">their website&lt;/a> to see how good. What do I get?&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>1. A flash only site. No fallback. Did they get it coded from a high-school flash junkie?
2. After 15 minutes of looking around clicking on 10s of links, going in circles, I'm still confused. What exactly are their packages. There are so many rates and offers floating around. Everything promising something different, but wait, not available for your region. There are so many channels, more than your current DTH, but one second, WHAT exactly are thos channels. No list? For all I care, they could be endless streams of Doordarshan and ETV regional ones. (Please repeat the question I asked in point 1 here again)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Makes me wonder, do they really want to sell anything or Anil just made this out for fun, having a roaring time watching realtime website logs seeing people getting stuck and frustrated in the maze.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Splert: Shantz Pidgin Away Alerts</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/08/18/splert-shantz-pidgin-away-alerts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2008 16:55:03 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/08/18/splert-shantz-pidgin-away-alerts/</guid><description>This is a simple tool I wrote a few months ago to turn Pidgin, everyone’s favourite multi-client Instant Messenger (works with gtalk, msn, yahoo, aim etc), into a customized answering machine (and more) when you are away from your computer.

Basically it allows you to divide up your contact list into groups based on email IDs and execute actions based on when someone from a particular group messages you while you are away. e.g. For general friends, you can keep a message like “Will talk to you later when I come back”, or if someone from office IMs you, it’ll send them your phone number “Call me at XXXXXX if urgent”. And if you boss is the one pinging you, you could direct the message towards your twitter account so that you get it as an SMS on your phone immediately.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Time is short, so here are the details:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Features:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Group based rule execution, each group can contain any number of email IDs&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Custom replies for each group.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Integrates with twitter and will forward the message to your twitter account (or send a direct message to some other account) if you so desire. (Temporarily disabled since Twitter has blocked their IM bot)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Runs as a separate process over d-bus instead of running as a pidgin plugin, so much lesser chances of crashing.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Prerequisites:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Pidgin &amp;gt; 2.4.1&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Linux&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Download:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Usage:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Unzip the attached package anywhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Either install using the deb package or just copy the splert binary and config.txt to a folder of your choice&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Modify the “config.txt” file according to your needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Run splert. (or run splert -h for checking out the available options though you wouldn’t need them most of the times)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Config File:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Config file fields and formats are explained fully in the sample config file included in the attached file. However, here is a very basic sample configuration:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>[Friends]
user = &lt;a href="mailto:foo@foo.com">foo@foo.com&lt;/a>
message = &amp;ldquo;Not Here. Will talk to you later&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[VIP]
user = &lt;a href="mailto:boss@boss.com">boss@boss.com&lt;/a>
message = &amp;ldquo;Got your message. Will Contact you asap&amp;rdquo;
twitter = 1
twitterto = my2ndtwitteracct&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>ChangeLog:&lt;/strong>
0.03 - Oct04 2008 -&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Added option to specify twitter bot id (e.g. &lt;a href="mailto:twitterspy@jabber.org">twitterspy@jabber.org&lt;/a>) using option &amp;ldquo;-t/-twitterbot&amp;rdquo;. However, you need to do any &amp;ldquo;extra&amp;rdquo; stuff manually. e.g. logging in using twlogin command with twitterspy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added option to specify the status when you want to send messages instead of just when being away. Use &amp;ldquo;-s/&amp;ndash;status&amp;rdquo; option to do this.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>0.02 - Aug25 2008 -&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Fixed bug where response was not sent for 1st message received&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added 32 bit package&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>0.01 - Aug15 2008 - Initial Version&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please let me know if you like it or found some issues with it. Also, let me know if you would like me to add any features to it.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Shantz Webcam Autolocker</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/08/11/shantz-webcam-autolocker/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2008 17:50:54 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/08/11/shantz-webcam-autolocker/</guid><description>Sometimes I do some things that even I can&amp;rsquo;t explain why I did &amp;rsquo;em.

Did this one in one of those times as well. This is a simple (and &lt;strong>useless&lt;/strong>) script to monitor motion in front of your PC, auto-lock it when you are away and auto-unlock it when you come back. Kinda useless cuz there is no security aspect (read face detection etc) and any kind of motion triggers the unlock. Did it just because I was really bogged down by the shitload of work that I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing for the past few weeks (and even weekends as well), so wanted to take a break for a few minutes, and just chanced over my own &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/2008/05/14/keep-tab-on-home-security-with-a-webcam-and-twitter.html">Home Security Using a Webcam and Twitter&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; post, so thought of doing something related to motion-detection again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Pre-requisites:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Works only in linux, primarily because the motion detection software we are going to use here works only in linux, otherwise we can port the script to other platforms.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You should have &lt;a href="http://lavrsen.dk/twiki/bin/view/Motion/DownloadFiles">motion&lt;/a> installed. If you are using Debian/Ubuntu or one of their derivatives, this is as simple as typing&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Otherwise, just go to the link above and download.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How-to:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is very simple.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Download the zip file attached to this post and unzip somewhere preferably in your home directory.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Open your terminal/command prompt. &amp;ldquo;cd&amp;rdquo; to the folder where you unzipped the zip file.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After loitering around for so long, I finally got my lazy bum off the bed and installed Hardy Heron (8.04.1) onto my aging laptop. I’ve never been a sucker for eye-candy stuff, prefering to have more resources available for real work, instead of ooh-aahing over nice looking things all around my desktop. Well, but then I fell prey. I thought of giving another try to the thingamagic that compiz-fusion is, moreso since I didn’t have to go through loads of installing nuances like feisty because of it being already integrated in Hardy. An emerald install and a few minutes of tinkering later, I had a cool looking screen staring back at me. Here is a preview screenshot for your eyes but obviously the static screenshot wont show the amazing dynamic effects of CF. Let me see how many days I keep this up before going back to my plain-jane self. Click on the pic for full view:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/desktop.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/desktop_thumb.jpg" alt="My all new and shiny desktop">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let me know if you have any suggestions to improve it further, or want more pics/vids of my new lappy in action, or have any of your own to share.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Update: Setup info:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Base Theme: Ubuntu Studio (basically for icon set. Download ubuntustudio-look package for this)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Controls : From Xenon theme (Inbuilt in Ubuntu)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Wallpaper is something named “lotus” or something. Downloaded from interfacelift.com&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Compiz Fusion with almost all effects turned on. Ofcourse you can’t see most of them in the still image&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Emerald theme engine for glassy and rounded window borders (Download “emerald” package)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Dock at the bottom is avant window navigator (awn. Download package avant-window-navigator)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>On right side, stats etc are from conky (Download package conky)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Misc: Turned transparency on for most things including gnome-terminal, gnome-panel, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Salient points:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The memory being consumed right now is around 850 MB. Thats with lots of applications, all CF effects turned on, most things having glass and transparent effects, and even my apache web server and mysql are running in background. And after that also, most memory (around 200 MB) is being eaten by firefox, leading to this high usage.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The setup boots up with just a shade over 300 MB being used, even though I’ve set CF and emerald on by default at boot and even apache and mysql start running on startup. :)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p>I fear that I will always be&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lonely number like root three&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The three is all that’s good and right,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why must my three keep out of sight&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beneath the vicious square root sign,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wish instead I were a nine&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For nine could thwart this evil trick,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>with just some quick arithmetic&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know I’ll never see the sun, as 1.7321&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Such is my reality, a sad irrationality&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When hark! What is this I see,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another square root of a three&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As quietly co-waltzing by,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Together now we multiply&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To form a number we prefer,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rejoicing as an integer&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We break free from our mortal bonds&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the wave of magic wands&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our square root signs become unglued&lt;/p>

Always give an exit path, a way to make it all go away, make it look like nothing happened. But Gnome seems to think otherwise. Any settings window you open, all you see is a “close” button.

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Pressing the “close” button.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Pressing the little “x” on the upper right corner.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Pressing “Alt+F4”.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>But no dice. Every method leads to saving of changes. The same thing occurs with EVERY dialogue box you can find in Gnome. I hate to say that this is something Windows seems to have got right (Maybe their UI designers are better than their OS programmers). What’s even more surprising is that even cross-platform apps (e.g. Firefox) give the “Apply” and “Cancel” buttons in Windows but not in Linux.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope Gnome developers listen and patch this up, or if there is any “hidden” tricks up your sleeve that will allow me to “go back in time”, please do let me know.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>More iPhone 3G Nonsense Uncovered: No Tethering</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/06/14/more-iphone-3g-nonsense-uncovered-no-tethering/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2008 15:57:50 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/06/14/more-iphone-3g-nonsense-uncovered-no-tethering/</guid><description>iPhone 3G, the “supposedly” latest and greatest handhled, just continues to amaze me, with its ridiculousness of course.

&lt;p>HSDPA/HSUPA my a**. I mean what good is a “3G” device that doesn’t even let you use the potential of the hyper-speeds by connecting to your bigger machines or even doing video calls. Oh right, I forgot, now you can check your e-mail at 50 messages per minute, WOOHOO!!, I’m so l33t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far the only good things I’ve noticed about the new release are:The MobileMe aka “sync-with-anything-anywhere” service, which although paid (obviously, its Apple we are talking about here), is still interesting. And the new SDK 2.0 that promises the 3rd party devs the same access to the phone as Apple’s devs, seems to be a step in the right direction though it remains to be seen how much of this is actually followed up on by Apple.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, what do you feel is &lt;strong>THE&lt;/strong> revolutionary thing about this new Cupertino offering?

Folks, here it is, the 5 comic strips that I love the most (in no particular order):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>1. &lt;a href="http://dilbert.com/">Dilbert&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>: Our friendly neighbourhood engineer is in town. Have fun reading through his daily life&amp;rsquo;s traumas. Of course, his tragedies couldn&amp;rsquo;t be as funny without the able support of the likes of Wally, Asok, dogbert, catbert, and yeah the &amp;ldquo;pointy haired manager&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2. &lt;a href="http://xkcd.com/">XKCD&lt;/a>:&lt;/strong> Don&amp;rsquo;t know if this is the abbreviated form of something but the author calls it a webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language. You&amp;rsquo;d be frowning at your monitor screen right now, trying to understand the relation between these things but you know the saying, There is the biggest order behind the biggest chaos (or something, I just made up that saying just now :-) )&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**3. &lt;a href="http://userfriendly.org/">Userfriendly&lt;/a>: **This is a story about a small ISP with your regular, average joe, sys-admins having a fun time at the expense of their unsuspecting management and, of course, about Pitr who has bigger plans for world domination than even google.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**4. &lt;a href="http://www.cad-comic.com/">Ctrl+Alt+Del&lt;/a>: **Your last resort on Windows is now your daily appetite in the form of this little story about (mis)adventures of a group of nerdy friends who just love to get into trouble, all while playing that game of Halo with one hand (and that too tied behind their backs).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>5. &lt;a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/">Penny Arcade&lt;/a>:&lt;/strong> If you are a gamer, you can&amp;rsquo;t miss this. Even &amp;ldquo;Jack Thomson&amp;rdquo; couldn&amp;rsquo;t, so you know, this one is a keeper ;-).&lt;/p>

One of the main highlights of all the stories, news and reviews doing the rounds are that this is an LTS version. But many people, mostly those who are new to Ubuntu, and even a few who are already using it, are not sure what LTS really means.</description><content>&lt;p>With the recent release of Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron), a lot of hype was generated (Overhype or well-deserved, that’s for another post). One of the main highlights of all the stories, news and reviews doing the rounds are that this is an LTS version. But many people, mostly those who are new to Ubuntu, and even a few who are already using it, are not sure what LTS really means.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Literally expanded, it stands for &lt;strong>Long Term Support&lt;/strong>. Yeah right, but what does it actually mean. Does it mean I’ll keep getting updates till eternity or what? The explanation is quite simple really.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Long Term:&lt;/strong> What it means is that while a normal non-LTS is supported for 18 months, an LTS version will be supported for 3 years or 36 months (and 5 years for the server version).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Support: **Now, don’t just jump into downloading it and installing on reading the long term part. This DOES NOT mean that you’ll continue getting newer versions of favourite software packages till that time. This only means that you’ll continue getting “security updates” for 3 (or 5) years. What’s the difference, some might ask, as they think that the newest version of a software is the most secure. However it is not so. A newer version may bring more features, but also more code to become vulnerable to bugs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, in a nutshell, to understand the situation, let’s take an example. If Hardy has a software X with version 1.3, and after 2 years the software moves to version 2.5, you’ll not be able to get version 2.5 from the hardy repositories but a version “1.x-ubuntuy”, which will have all the security and major bug fixes for that software, but not the new features that you might see in later versions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I just did this post so that people don’t jump into it by getting a wrong impression about LTS and later on be disappointed on learning the fact. So, now you can make an informed decision.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>The Elusive Super Phone</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/05/08/the-elusive-super-phone/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2008 17:15:28 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/05/08/the-elusive-super-phone/</guid><description>HTC announce their shiny new Touch Diamond recently.

Everyone ooh&amp;rsquo;ed and aah&amp;rsquo;ed while ogling at it until they realized that HTC has taken a step back (or forward towards matching Apple&amp;rsquo;s iPhone crap) by removing the expansion card slot from the phone. Yes, it has 4 GB of internal storage but I&amp;rsquo;d rather have an SDHC card slot with the ever falling prices of solid state memory (an 8 GB Class 6 SDHC card is worth not more than around 60$ these days). With a history of ultimate-gift-to-mankind phones like HTC Tytn, HTC Tytn II (Kaiser), iPhone, etc that excite so much on the first look and then start becoming dimmer and unwanted as the euphoria settles, we are left to wonder when will we see the real &amp;ldquo;Super Phone&amp;rdquo;. The do-it-all-be-all-end-all phone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, my prediction is (Nostradamus style) : **NEVER. **No sir, you are not going to see your dream phone any time soon, or any time at all, for that matter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why do I say that. The reasons are pretty obvious, once we take off our wishful thinking hats and don the smart thinking ones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**1. ****A new dream every day: **Around 8-10 years ago, I wished I had a cell phone. Around 6 years ago, I wish I had one with a camera. Around 4 years ago, I wish I had a phone with Mp3 player and expandable memory. 3 years ago I wished for a smart phone. Now, I wish for&amp;hellip;. You get it. By the time something comes out, our dreams have already moved on. After all they  aren&amp;rsquo;t called &amp;ldquo;dreams&amp;rdquo; just like that ;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**2. Where is the money: **You might be ready to give a fortune (and your first born son) for that ultimate phone, but the evil-phone-conglomerate wants much more than that. They want you to be slaves. They don&amp;rsquo;t want the world to spend a huge amount in one go and then stop. They need to mint more money and too much more frequently than you&amp;rsquo;d like to spend. This is why the strategy works. Give out a phone that has slim form factor, nice UI, wi-fi, but then make the processor crappy (Touch), then lure them with a better processor but take out the wi-fi (Touch Dual), Add the wi-fi back and slap in a keyboard too, but keep&amp;rsquo;em wanting for &lt;a href="http:///2008/01/28/htc-the-best-windows-mobile-business-unit.html">better graphics&lt;/a> (Kaiser), give &amp;rsquo;em a shiny new toy, but then lock it down in every possible (iCrap). So, you&amp;rsquo;d be stuck in the vicious circle of &amp;ldquo;upgrades&amp;rdquo; and keep the phone factory churning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, my dear fellow phone lovers, stop wasting your time waiting for that ultimate phone, and go &amp;ldquo;upgrade&amp;rdquo; at once, because &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rdquo; phone with just &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rdquo; one more feature&amp;hellip;ISN&amp;rsquo;T COMING&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Http 406 Errors Galore</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/05/01/http-406-errors-galore/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2008 15:30:05 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/05/01/http-406-errors-galore/</guid><description>If you have ever had these errors or just want to be prepared in case they pop up somtime (and they surely will), then read on as I discuss various situations that lead to them and also their solutions.

&lt;p>I generally use desktop clients (mostly blogjet, but also Windows Live Writer and Scribe Fire sometimes) to blog to my WordPress based blogs. Some months ago, I started getting &amp;ldquo;Http 406: Not Acceptable&amp;rdquo; error while posting a particular post. Tried posting through the WordPress inbuilt TinyMCE editor, but got the same result. A little bit of research told me that this was because the post contained some words that were considered harmful by the &amp;ldquo;mod_security&amp;rdquo; plugin for apache that had been installed by my host to prevent hacking attempts. The quick resolution was to include the following lines in my .htaccess:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&amp;lt;ifmodule mod_security.c&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>SecFilterEngine Off
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>SecFilterScanPOST Off
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&amp;lt;/ifmodule&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Sure enough, I put them in, published the post, and it worked. But since this meant opening up my site to the real hacking attempts, I commented them out and went about my work, occassionally turning them on as and when required.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, a few days ago, after a server upgrade, the problem reared its head again, and in a more vicious manner. I started getting the dreaded 406 error again, and this time for any post, even a blank post, and through all clients. But this time, TinyMCE was working without issues. A little bit of looking around my site told me that the problem was that my desktop clients were not able to connect to my &amp;ldquo;x mlrpc.php&amp;rdquo; file which is responsible for taking care of all the remote api provided by WordPress. Trying to access it through any means provided the 406 error. My site&amp;rsquo;s error log was filled with:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Now, the xml rpc methods are used not just by WordPress but many other CMS&amp;rsquo;s (like drupal, joomla, etc) and sure enough a quick search resulted in many similar reports for all the platforms. Enabling my previous mod_security options resulted in &amp;ldquo;503: Server misconfiguration&amp;rdquo; errors, complicating things further.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On seeing the error logs, I found that the server could not understand the options, and then I discovered that the mod_security had been upgraded to and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t backward compatible with old options. Modifying the options to their latest counterparts also didn&amp;rsquo;t work, as further wading through mod_security manual told me that now, its options cannot be overridden through .htaccess and can only be changed by the web admin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I found that my host has basically blocked the x mlrpc.php file from being accessed at all instead of using proper rules for blocking only the attacks while allowing valid accesses. This was the problem that a huge number of people are also having and moreover they (like me) are not able to convince their hosts to switch to proper rules.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, not all hope is lost. I have &amp;ldquo;fixed&amp;rdquo; this issue with a workaround for now. It is pretty simple really. Just rename your x mlrpc.php to something else (e.g. myrpc123.php) and also replace all references to it in your CMS with your new file name. You can use sed to automate this task. I used perl however:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>perl -e 's/x mlrpc.php/myrpc123.php/gi' -p -i *&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, the 406 errors should be gone. If this worked for you, or you had any issues let me know. Also, if you have any other workarounds/fixes of your own, do drop me a word.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note:&lt;/strong> In the above article, please ignore the space between &amp;ldquo;x&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;mlrpc&amp;rdquo; as the mod_security rules prevent them from being in content also. Moreover, use some unique name for rpc file.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Page Rank 7: True Or Google Glitch?</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/30/page-rank-7-true-or-google-glitch/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2008 20:33:51 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/30/page-rank-7-true-or-google-glitch/</guid><description>I installed google toolbar (linux version) today in firefox and for this blog, it says that its page rank is 7.

Note that I didn&amp;rsquo;t go for GIMP / Inkscape etc because they were overkill for what I wanted to do. Many a times, I just wanted to touch up a screenshot or make a simple flow image by drawing a few boxes, use a few pointing arrows, and add some text here and there. All this could be done with the previous mentioned programs as well but took a bit more steps than I wanted (stroking the selections / paths for lines, boxes, circles, and even then, no arrows). I didn&amp;rsquo;t find an adequate replacement at the time but got it now, so thought of writing about it. Basically I came across 4 apps: tuxpaint, gpaint, kolourpaint and mtpaint. Won&amp;rsquo;t discuss tuxpaint here cuz I found it a little too kiddish.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>gpaint: (Available in Ubuntu repositories) gpaint is a very simplistic program that has a mspaint look and feel but feels a bit lacking. It can do basic procedures like basic shape selections, lines, boxes but that&amp;rsquo;s it. No polygon selections, brush, color picker, etc, and yeah no arrows. Moreover, it saves only in pngs.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/gpaint.png">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/gpaint-thumb.png" alt="gpaint screenshot">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>kolourpaint: (Available in Ubuntu Repositories) kolourpaint is very close to mspaint. Infact it does a bit more than mspaint. It has all the things that I mentioned as missing in gpaint, plus has basic image manipulation effects as well. I liked it quite a bit, but it had 2 drawbacks for me, still no arrows, and it depends on KDE/Qt libraries.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/kolourpaint.png">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/kolourpaint-thumb.png" alt="kolourpaint screenshot">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>mtpaint: (Available in Ubuntu Repositories from Gutsy onwards. Rest of the folks can search for a package on net, or find a suitable package or source &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=155874&amp;amp;package_id=173703">here&lt;/a>) This is the software that got me most excited. It is actually a kind of lower-intermediate package that lies somewhere between mspaint and a very basic, poor man&amp;rsquo;s GIMP. It has all the features ok kolourpaint, (plus arrows at last :-) ), a small smattering of basic effects (gaussian, edge detection, blur, embossing), can work with gifs also (handles transparency and animation quite well). So, this is the one I would be sticking to for now.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/mtpaint.png">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/mtpaint-thumb.png" alt="mtpaint screenshot">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am using mtpaint now for my basic needs. Hope the article benefitted you as well. If I missed out on some package, then do let me know.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>ImageMagick: Weaving Magic With Your Pictures</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/26/imagemagick-weaving-magic-with-your-pictures/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2008 06:23:18 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/26/imagemagick-weaving-magic-with-your-pictures/</guid><description>I’ve known about ImageMagick tools for quite some time now but never dabbled with it.

A couple of weeks ago I played with it for some time (notice the new cascaded polaroid pics header above) and was amazed even more. Few of its shining features:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It has almost unlimited features to manipulate your images through its tools like convert, montage, mogrify etc and their long list of options.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It is available for Windows, Linux and Mac as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Runs on web servers also (most of those nifty image sites use it for run time image manipulation)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It is amazingly fast.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Runs on the command line, which means batching of operations can be done and is also good for butter fingered people like me who are clumsy with GUI based image manipulation programs&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Has modules for interfacing with C, perl, php, C++, C#, java, etc. So, you can create your own applications around it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It’s FREE (as in speech and as in beer)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It has an amazing documentation over at imagemagick.org and also a very thriving community, so help is just a few clicks away.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As a very rudimentary sample of what it can do for you, take a look at my blog’s header above. I just gave it a few pics and ran a command, and it resized them, turned them into polaroid pics, rotated them at random angles, made the background transparent, strung them together to make a webpage header/banner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since the command was specific for the number and names of images, I made a simple perl script to automate the command making process so you can also download this script (link at the end of post) and run it to create your own header. (You might want to tweak the $w and $h variables in the script to specify your header’s width and height). Running it would be like&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>./pano.pl &amp;lt;imagenames&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>e.g.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>./pano.pl myimages/*
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>After I made this script, I came across &lt;a href="http://stason.org/photos/gallery/">Stas Bekman’s photo gallery&lt;/a> which has a much better and cool stack effect with photos. And he generously agreed to share his script (much more sophisticated than my my few lines) with me. His script is also attached below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let me know if you use any of these scripts (as it is or after modifying them) to create any cool effects.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>5 Reasons I Like Linux (And 5 Why I Dislike It)</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/19/5-reasons-i-like-linux-and-5-why-i-dislike-it/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2008 20:20:40 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/19/5-reasons-i-like-linux-and-5-why-i-dislike-it/</guid><description>Disclaimer Notes:

Though at a few places, it might be necessary to compare the two just to put things into perspective.</description><content>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Disclaimer Notes:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I wrote this because these things just came into my mind today while I was reading about the impending “Hardy Heron” release related things and saw that there is a lot of FUD being spread still. So, thought of jotting down my likes/dislikes and not making it a linux v/s windows campaign. Though at a few places, it might be necessary to compare the two just to put things into perspective.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>These are reasons why “&lt;strong>I&lt;/strong>” like/dislike Linux and not why others might like/dislike it although you might find common patterns.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Most of my recent experience is with Ubuntu these days, so most examples would be from it as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>These reasons are purely from an end-user’s perspective and not from a linux developer’s perspective. So, I’m not taking into factor that I can change the kernel (or most other things’) source code because “generally” I don’t.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>This post is quite long. And if you have a flame to send out my way (which you are most welcome to do), please read it in its entirety before doing so, because many things I say at some point have some caveats covered at another point.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>5 Reasons why I like Linux:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These reasons aren’t listed in any particular order. All of them are quite important for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>1. Light on Resources&lt;/strong>: I must say that Linux is what still keeps my more than 3 years old laptop running in a prim condition with the latest and greatest of everything from technology stand-point as well as eye-candy stuff. An example: With almost every effect of Compiz Fusion turned on, hordes of screenlets and AWN enabled, an Apache/MySQL/PHP based server running, and a dozen of other applications (firefox, nautilus, terminal, GIMP, RhythmBox, Open Office Word Processor, VLC player, etc) open, my setup consumes around 500 MB of RAM. While on the other hand, if I was using Vista, It’d have demanded atleast 1 GB of RAM just to run Aero, forget about the rest of the things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2. Cost&lt;/strong>: This is a big factor for me. Almost everything is free or atleast has a free alternative available. Most of the times I’ve found these free software to be much better than commercial software in terms of feature sets as well as stability. But even otherwise, when there are cases where the free alternative a bit lagging as compared to the commercial one (e.g. GIMP v/s Photoshop), I haven’t felt that my needs have ever outgrown the free software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>3. Ease of Use&lt;/strong>: Doing “stuff” on linux is just so easy. By “stuff”, I mean everything from doing some normal day chores, downloading files, customizing things, automating routine tasks, etc. The backbone for this is “the terminal” (not the movie :P). I can do almost anything I want from the console. It not only saves me time and frustration in executing a program, waiting for the GUI to load and then go through a series of clicks but also allows me to batch up everything into one pretty little command. Moreover, every thing has so many options that I can configure to my liking. (More on the “options” later below)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>4. Getting Software&lt;/strong>: Getting software couldn’t be more easy.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It generally involves typing in “sudo apt-get install &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->”, pressing enter, and that’s it. The latest version is ready to roll on your machine.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Reboots are minimal. Even after thinking for quite long, it’s very hard to recall any time when I had to “log-off” my system (let alone reboot) after installing a software (or even a driver)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Updates are automatic, and not just for the OS or a few core components, but for all the software that I installed through repositories (but not for the ones which I installed from my local deb’s or compilations, which is understandable of course)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The latest fixes/patches are available very quickly. Moreover, the revision cycle for most distros lies between 6–12 months and hence, even a complete desktop upgrade is quickly available as well (as compared to the 7 year period after which Vista came out). You can even “upgrade” to the latest distro revision without having to wipe everything, though I generally prefer a clean install.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>5. Security&lt;/strong>:Now, I agree with everyone that the reason why we don’t see many viruses for linux is because the user base is very less as compared to other OS’s but I also believe that this is not the “only” reason.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The thing is that since most of the software is open source, so exploits are found quite quickly and patched and released rapidly. While in a closed source environments, even if a white hat reports it, the exploits go on un-noticed, un-worked upon by the developers (A good example is the recent falling of Vista during the “Pwn to Own” contest because of a known but unpatched vulnerability by Adobe, not a fault of Vista in this case though but you get my drift).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The security model otherwise is also quite tight and its very hard for someone to exploit it till the time you use common sense along with it. (A linux virus can easily wipe ur “/home” without acqurining root permissions).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>5 Reasons why I dislike Linux&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These reasons irk me the most but aren’t enough for to make me move away from Linux. I mention them because getting them right would make my Linux expereince that much more joyful and probably others feels the same too. Moreover, this is not a gripe and is not a command/order to “the Linux guys” out there to fix it, because linux is of, by and for the community. And being a part of this community, I share the burden of this equally and would like to help out in making it better in whatever ways possible, developing, testing, suggesting things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**1. Getting Software: **I had mentioned about how easy it is to get software from most distros’ repositories with a single command. However, getting and installing software is also a challenge that many people face in linux. After sometime your particular version of the distro stops updating the software and will include only security fixes and such. Now, there are many good people who would backport software for your version but not all the time. You can download pacakges off the internet (debs’ for ubuntu) but they might not work because of too many inter-mingled dependencies. Compiling is another option but many times, it can spiral out of hand. I hope we can better softwares like GDebi that could make this much more easier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**2. Options: **Earlier I listed having so many options as one of my reasons to like Linux. But, sometimes, too many options tend to get to my head. This gets even more difficult when you have too many choices but no clue about what means what and which one is the best. However, the community is continously trying to make this right. A lot of documentation projects are going on, and the mailing lists, IRC networks and other forums also give out a lot of information. Especially for Ubuntu, I find a huge community based support system which always helps me out. (PS – The Ubuntu Forums are the nicest forums you’ll ever come across. I am yet to come across a post that contains words like “RTFM” or “n00b”)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>3. Ease Of Use:&lt;/strong> Some times, just some times, the lack of a GUI for common things irks me and I wish in respect of a few things (read wi-fi) that things could “just work”. But I guess this is a trade-off that I can live with, and moreover this situation is also improving especilly due to the efforts taken by Ubuntu, Mandriva, Fedora, GNOME and KDE. (Special thanks to nm-applet ;-) ). Moreover, Hardy Heron, b43 and the latest linux kernels promise to solve the wi-fi setup issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>4. Browsing&lt;/strong>: The browsing experience on linux isn’t too great. But this is not a fault of Linux as such. This is due to companies providing adequate linux support (e.g. java plugins for 64 bit) and too many sites optimizing their code for IE. But again, there is hope for this as we can already run IE on linux (IEs4Linux) plus SUN has promised a 64 bit java firefox plugin with the next JRE.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**5. Drivers: **This is again due to companies not giving proper linux support for their hardware and not even releasing their hardware details for the OSS community to develop their own drivers. However, I can understand that giving out hardware details might not be an option for these companies considering the competition, and also proper software support might be a bit unfeasible due to a smaller consumer base. But again, more and more companies are seeing the light now and releasing proper drivers for linux, with Nvidia and ATi taking the lead (When will Creative listen?). And a special thanks to the OSS community for making working drivers despite all this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>So, this is it. After reading back through what I just wrote, I am dead sure that I will stick to Linux as the trade-offs are too meagre for me. Will you?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Gmail Blocking Messages to Yahoo Groups?</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/13/gmail-blocking-messages-to-yahoo-groups/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2008 16:58:36 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/13/gmail-blocking-messages-to-yahoo-groups/</guid><description>For the past couple of days I have been unable to send any mails to any of my yahoo groups through my gmail account.

Everyone wants to do something new and extra-ordinary. People like me (read software engineers) want to develop &amp;ldquo;something&amp;rdquo; cool. BUT, the stage where most of them go wrong is the very first one. Most of them think that the road to develop something cool starts from a particular &amp;ldquo;language&amp;rdquo; or a tool. But I beg to differ. I say the first stage is &amp;ldquo;The Idea&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most of my friends and others around me think that having a particular skill set is very important to develop something the world hasn&amp;rsquo;t seen till now. And for this they end up reading through piles of books, which claim to make them a master in C, C++, PHP, Python, Web 2.0 and what not. This is all OK, but the problem is, when they have gone through the books, done all the exercises, made all the samle projects, then they have a question in their minds &amp;ldquo;Now What&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What I think is that this question should have been asked in the very beginning of the journey. And it should have been answered by the occurrence of a new idea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong. I&amp;rsquo;m all for reading books, developing skill sets, learning new technologies, etc. But the only point I want to make is that all this is a &amp;ldquo;means&amp;rdquo; to give your &amp;ldquo;idea&amp;rdquo; a shape. They are not where your story begins. What if you spent a lot of time acquiring perl skills and then when (and if) you get your brilliant idea, you find out that the best way to implement it would be using C. Are you back to square one? No. Skills acquired are never a waste. &amp;ldquo;Concepts&amp;rdquo; developed can easily be applied to the new tool that you have to use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But one more thing, its again not a hard rule that now you should just sit in your chair all day long and keep thinking. I bet its much harder to get the idea stream flowing that way. Ideas don&amp;rsquo;t have a pattern that they follow while coming into your mind. They may come to you any place unexpected (I get most of mine while bathing ;-) ).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But there is something you can do to ensure that your brain gets accustomed to recognize an idea when you do get it. So, while you are reading through that book on C programming, don&amp;rsquo;t just get engrossed in typing out the exact source code that&amp;rsquo;s fed to you. &amp;ldquo;Think&amp;rdquo; about whether is that enough? Can you make some modification to it so that it becomes more efficient? Can you tweak it a bit to do more than its already doing?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Keep your eyes open when you go around your daily chores. Think when you open your door whether wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice if the door could recognize you are there and open itself. There&amp;rsquo;s your idea. And while you are at it, think wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be even nicer if your home would have poured you a cool drink itself when you enter it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, tell me whether you would like to wait to think about these ideas till you read the book&amp;rsquo;s epilogue, or do you want to start thinking now?&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Project: My WordPress Plugin shantz-wp-qotd updated to version 1.2.2</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/10/project-my-wordpress-plugin-shantz-wp-qotd-updated-to-version-122/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2008 20:33:41 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/10/project-my-wordpress-plugin-shantz-wp-qotd-updated-to-version-122/</guid><description>Updated my WordPress plugin shantz-wp-qotd to version 1.2.2 today.

Most of the times, this is as simple as adding some simple lines to .htaccess (e.g. &lt;code>AddHandler application/x-httpd-php5 .php&lt;/code> ). And you might not notice any issues. But many of you still do. The issues range from weird page layouts, to some controls not working, to some errors popping up here and there, and probably your blog not even displaying. This occurs because even though WordPress is PHP5 compatible, some of the plugins you are using might not be. But even if you ensure that all your plugins are PHP5 compatible, there is still one more problem that I just saw today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Problem: **My host supports both PHP4 and PHP5. I decided to migrate &lt;a href="http://blog.shantanugoel.com/">my personal blog&lt;/a> to PHP5 today by adding the aforementioned line to my .htaccess. Immediately, my blog disappeared, and in its place, all that was left was a few errors:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>[07-Apr-2008 12:11:49] PHP Warning: flock() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /…/wp-cache-phase2.php on line 105
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>[07-Apr-2008 12:11:49] PHP Warning: fopen/…/wp-cache-e3ba4b7161eb59d50c5e976a0b66782a.meta) [&amp;lt;a href=&amp;#39;function.fopen&amp;#39;&amp;gt;function.fopen&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;]: failed to open stream: Permission denied in /…/wp-cache-phase2.php on line 240
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>[07-Apr-2008 12:11:49] PHP Warning: fputs(): supplied argument is not a valid stream resource in /…/wp-cache-phase2.php on line 241
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Note: I&amp;rsquo;ve deleted the exact file paths above for security reasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It gave me an idea that it had something to do with wp-cache. When I tried to open the settings for wp-cache, it again gve error that web server doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the permissions to write the file wp-cache-config.php, wp_cache_mutex.lock etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Analysis:&lt;/strong> On checking the file permissions for these mentioned files, I found that they already belong to the user under which the web server runs. So, write permissions shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been a problem. I guessed that maybe this issue is because of another &amp;ldquo;handler&amp;rdquo; (x-httpd-php5) now trying to modify the files while earlier they were created by the php4 handler. But I couldn&amp;rsquo;t change the permissions now because they were created by the web server and I can&amp;rsquo;t modify/delete them through ssh/ftp under my username.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Solution: **So, the solution (or workaround as you may call it) was to login to my cpanel, and use the &amp;ldquo;File Manager&amp;rdquo; there, since all operations done by it would also be carried out by the web-server. So, all I did was:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Went back to PHP4&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Disabled WP-Cache Plugin&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Launched the file manager, deleted the wp-content/wp-cache-config.php and wp-content/cache/wp_cache_mutex.lock. Came out.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Enabled PHP5 in .htaccess&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Enable the WP-Cache Plugin&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>And that&amp;rsquo;s it. My Personal Blog is now running happily over PHP5 goodness :). let me know if you have any comments about this or any other suggestions that are better than this workaround.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note:&lt;/strong> This problem might not be limited to WP-Cache alone. There might be other plugins as well having the same problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Note2: **If you feel uncomfortable deleting any file, then make a copy of it through ssh/ftp (so that it is under your user name), delete the original file, and replace it by the copy you made. Now, you can give this file a permission of &amp;ldquo;777&amp;rdquo; (that is readable, writable, executable by all), so that the web server can also modify it.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Twittering Away With Delhi Bloggers</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/06/twittering-away-with-delhi-bloggers/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2008 14:57:24 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/06/twittering-away-with-delhi-bloggers/</guid><description>If you are twittering kinds, doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter online or offline

But it wasn&amp;rsquo;t that good as it took care of only the situation when this phenomena was caused by the tag cloud widget. So, here is a little modification I did to fix the issue more properly.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Go to your wp-content/themes/&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> folder and open the style.css file in your favourite text editor.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Search for &amp;ldquo;#sidebar&amp;rdquo; (without the quotes) until you reach the following code:&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>#sidebar-right,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>#sidebar-left {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> width: 210px;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> color: #666666;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> line-height: 160%;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>Now, modify this code to look like:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>#sidebar-right,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>#sidebar-left {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> width: 210px;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> color: #666666;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> line-height: 160%;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> word-wrap: break-word;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>That&amp;rsquo;s it. Save your file and you are done.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>So what does it do? Basically I just added an attribute &amp;ldquo;word-wrap: break-word&amp;rdquo; to the sidebar handling. So, if there is a word that cannot fit in the sidebar width, the word will be broken to continue in the next line and thus the sidebar alignment will remain intact. let me know if you face any issues with this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note&lt;/strong> that this particular word-wrap property is Internet Explorer specific. Firefox (and other browsers) will ignore it, but since the problem with sidebar alignment occurs only with IE, so it will enable IE to display your site properly.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Download pidgin 2.4.1 For Ubuntu Feisty Fawn (amd64/x86_64)</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/04/download-pidgin-241-for-ubuntu-feisty-fawn-amd64x86_64/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2008 17:19:02 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/04/04/download-pidgin-241-for-ubuntu-feisty-fawn-amd64x86_64/</guid><description>pidgin is everybody&amp;rsquo;s favourite IM client.

&lt;p>pidgin is everybody&amp;rsquo;s favourite IM client. Lifehacker includes it in its list of top 5 IM clients. Obviously I use it too, but one drawback of being lazy and not switching over to Gutsy Gibbon was that I was stuck with version 2.2.0 for a long time. But recently I began a new journey towards d-bus programming and chose pidgin as my companion. Found out that 2.2.0 has some serious d-bus issues on amd64 that were fixed in 2.4.0. Hence, installed all the dependencies, compiled the latest version today from source and installed it. Just thought of putting it out for my fellow Feisty users who are looking to upgrade as well but don&amp;rsquo;t want to go through the mess of compiling from source.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So download it from the below given link. However, since it is a relatively big package (around 8.5 MB), I might pull it if the bandwidth usage becomes too much, so download soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can install it by:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Either using &amp;ldquo;gdebi&amp;rdquo; - A nice deb package installer that will also try to resolve dependencies for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>or by running &amp;ldquo;dpkg -i pidgin_2.4.1-1_amd64.deb&amp;rdquo; on command line.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

Yes, I just downloaded it through WordPress.org though can’t find it being mentioned anywhere on WordPress Development Blog.

I’m sure you have copied/moved files on your computer from one place to another. And I’m sure often you have to do more than just “single-shot” copying that is copy a few files to one place, move a few to another, and copy yet some more to one more location. Well, I had to do this quite a few times (e.g. I ran out of disk space recently on a partition and had to empty out my “Movies” and “Songs” folders to move a few movies/songs each to all other partitions/disks according to the space available).</description><content>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Introduction:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m sure you have copied/moved files on your computer from one place to another. And I’m sure often you have to do more than just “single-shot” copying that is copy a few files to one place, move a few to another, and copy yet some more to one more location. Well, I had to do this quite a few times (e.g. I ran out of disk space recently on a partition and had to empty out my “Movies” and “Songs” folders to move a few movies/songs each to all other partitions/disks according to the space available). Hence, I wrote this little command line program, which behaves like a basket.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can put any number of files from any number of different locations into it in a single shot. It will store their locations and give them an ID. Now, you can copy/move those files to differnet destinations based on their IDs. What&amp;rsquo;s even better is that your basket will remain intact even across reboots. So, you can continue working on the files in the basket even for days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Requirements:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The program is multi-platform compatible as I wrote it in Perl and took care of using portable methods only. So, if you have perl installed, you can just download the above perl file and install “File-Copy-Recursive” Module (rest are most probably installed already) and you are good to go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For people who don’t have perl, I’ve uploaded the stand-alone packages for windows as well as linux users. Download according to your platform and you can use them straight away without any hassles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the record, I tested this script as well as the executables on Windows XP SP2 and Ubuntu Feisty Fawn 7.04.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Usage:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>shantz-cp [OPTION] [FILE] [DESTPATH]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Options:
-l, &amp;ndash;list List files in the basket.
Doesn&amp;rsquo;t take [FILE]/[DEST] Arguments
-a, &amp;ndash;add Add file(s) to the basket.
Provide absolute/relative path of file(s) as argument
-r, &amp;ndash;remove Remove file(s) from the basket
Provide absolute/relative path of file(s) as argument
-ri, &amp;ndash;removeid Remove file(s) from the basket using their basket id
Provide id(s) of file(s) as argument
-pi, &amp;ndash;pasteid Paste a file from the basket to the given destination
Provide file id(s) to be pasted followed by relative/absolute path of destination
-m, &amp;ndash;move Use this option along with paste option to move the files instead of copy&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Arguments:
[FILE] Any number of files can be mentioned
Paths can be relative to current dir or absolute
Cannot use with list option
[DESTPATH] Only 1 path can be given
Path can be relative to current dir or absolute
Can be used only with paste option&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Only 1 option can be used at a time, except for the &amp;ldquo;move&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;pasteid&amp;rdquo; combinations&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For any queries/help/updates, please post a comment here.&lt;/li>

Check its availability on one of the many domain sellers&amp;rsquo; sites. And if you picked &amp;ldquo;Network Solutions&amp;rdquo; to do the search, then you have just been scammed my dear friend.
Did you wonder, that though Network Solutions showed the domain name as available, but yet when you searched and found a cheaper registrar, the domain name was suddenly…GONE.</description><content>&lt;p>If you had a dream of starting your own website, your online abode, and you wanted to see whether the pretty little name for your dream house is available or not, what do you do? Check its availability on one of the many domain sellers&amp;rsquo; sites. And if you picked &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://www.networksolutions.com/">Network Solutions&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; to do the search, then you have just been scammed my dear friend.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Did you wonder, that though Network Solutions showed the domain name as available, but yet when you searched and found a cheaper registrar, the domain name was suddenly…&lt;strong>GONE&lt;/strong>..What about the second one you had searched for at NetSol? Gone. Third One? Gone. Now, what is the probability of all 3 names being registered within 5 minutes of you searching for them? Probably one in a billion. No, its one in one (100%) if you searched on Network Solutions, as a &lt;a href="http://blog.twilightfairy.in/">friend&lt;/a> of mine found out the hard way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Donning the detective cap, if you do a whois for all those domains, they will undoubtedly be registered with Network Solutions. And you are now in there clutches, to buy it for their exhorbitant prices, almost 4-5 times the normal prices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Actually, its not that bad as of now, because NetSol doesn&amp;rsquo;t really &amp;ldquo;buy&amp;rdquo; all those domain names (otherwise it&amp;rsquo;ll take less than a day for them to go bankrupt). They register it with ICANN but are allowed to cancel it within 5 days so they don&amp;rsquo;t have to pay any money. This clause was made to protect registrars from Credit Card fraud, but NetSol is using it to create their own fraud. As now, they can block the site for 5 days for free and people panic and buy it from them for their higher prices. They say that they do it to &amp;ldquo;protect&amp;rdquo; their customers. Hell, all they are protecting is the customers from buying it from their &amp;ldquo;cheaper&amp;rdquo; competitors as NetSol will sell it to anyone who pays and not just the guy who searched for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, if you have become a victim of this and can wait for 5 days, then do that instead of paying through your nose. I call for a boycott of all services of Network Solutions and not just the domain whois, so that they can learn a lesson.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Chinese LionKing800 cellphone claims 1-year standby</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/13/chinese-lionking800-cellphone-claims-1-year-standby/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2008 17:30:44 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/13/chinese-lionking800-cellphone-claims-1-year-standby/</guid><description>Even though they are using a battery with 10 times the juice of a normal one, but still the claim is impressive on 2 counts acc to me:

Nothing could be seen, clicking the picture button resulted in blank pics. Googling about it revealed an &lt;a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=PgComSmModDisplayAct&amp;amp;fcategoryid=218&amp;amp;modelid=13390&amp;amp;keycode=2112&amp;amp;id=29819">advisory&lt;/a> by Canon, stating that it is a known issue with the CCD image sensor. Canon impressed me by that notice when they said they will fix it for free, even for cameras out of warranty period, and will also pay to-and-fro shipping. Contacting canon support in India (support, in India? Is that a joke?) resulted in just their ignorance about any such advisory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Undeterred, I sent the camera to the land of dreams (USA) with a friend, e-mailed the Canon USA support at &lt;a href="mailto:carecenter@cits.canon.com">carecenter@cits.canon.com&lt;/a> with my predicament, and they promptly sent shipping labels to my friend. So far so good. But a couple of months went by, with no word from them. Customer support told me they are awaiting parts. Sad I was that day &lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/smile9.gif" alt="">.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One fine day, I just checked the status of the return shipping label on a whim, and found that they had shipped my camera back. I was disheartened thinking it had been returned unrepaired, but then my friend called to let me know that they had sent some other camera back. I thought they might have sent some low price, refurbished camera, but atleast a working camera is better than a non-working one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today my friend came back from the US, and what do we have? A brand spanking new &lt;a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0705/07050703canons5is.asp">Canon Powershot S5 IS &lt;/a>(8 MP, 12x Optical zoom, flip out and twist LCD). Yessir &lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/smile1.gif" alt="">. Here is a pic of my new baby (Ah, the irony, the clicking powerhouse has been clicked with a low-res phone camera, but anyways.)&lt;/p>

Using tar, making up the script file is enough command line for me. Isn’t there an easy way? &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crontab">Cron&lt;/a> is a tool that can schedule any kind of tasks for you, and here we are using it to run our backup script automatically, so that we can concentrate on blogging. Now, most of us are phobic of anything that has anything to do with command line. And we already have enough of command line stuff in this &lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/17/tip-automating-website-backups.html">series&lt;/a>. So, you can breathe a sigh of relief for a few moments because atleast the cron part can be made Web/GUI based for you (The command line method for cron was given in the &lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/17/tip-automating-website-backups.html">first part&lt;/a>). The details that I’m going to present here are relevant for cpanel but it might differ for you (very minor to very major) as your webhost might have a different panel for you (e.g. vdeck) or even your cpanel might look very different. But the basic concept remains the same and with a bit of common sense, you can apply this concept to your site easily.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Step1) Look for some option in your control panel, which says something on the lines of “cron”, “cron job” or such. e.g.:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Step2) If you get a screen as shown below, choose the experience level as “Standard” (maybe “novice” or similar in your panel). After all, we are using it because we want to avoid that unixy-command-line-stuff &lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/smile3.gif" alt="">.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>First, fill in the e-mail ID to which you want the script output to be sent to. (e.g. tar will output the list of files that were backed up) (e.g. &lt;a href="mailto:myemail@mysite.com">myemail@mysite.com&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, give the “&lt;strong>full&lt;/strong>” path (yes, starting from the root “/”) to your script that has to be run (e.g. /home/myusername/backup/backup.sh)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, choose the periodicity/time when this script has to be run, e.g., here we have chosen the script to be run everyday at 10:00 PM. **IMPORTANT: **Note that the time given here is GMT, so add your timezone offset. Generally, you should select a time when you expect the load on your website to be the lowest. e.g. I have selected a time of 3:00 AM everyday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Press “save”, “done”, “add’’ or whatever similar button you can find and it’s over &lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/smile1.gif" alt="">. That was easy innit?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s it for today. Lemme know if you have any doubts, or if you would like to see any other questions answered in this series. The question that will be answered next time (in “hopefully” the last part of the series) is:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q3:&lt;/strong> Well, backup is all hunky-dory. Now, how do I restore?&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Games: Wormux Reporting to Action, SIR!!!</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/03/games-wormux-reporting-to-action-sir/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2008 03:30:00 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/03/games-wormux-reporting-to-action-sir/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Alpha to Bravo, over.

With &lt;a href="http://www.wormux.org/">Wormux&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the words of its developers:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Wormux is pre-eminently a &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>convivial mass murder&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo; game where, turn by turn, each member of each team attempts to produce a maximum of damage to his opponents.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/worms1.png">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/worms1_thumb.jpg" alt="Wormux 1">&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/worms2.png">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/worms2_thumb.jpg" alt="Wormux 2">&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/worms3.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/worms3_thumb.jpg" alt="Wormux 3">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But whats a murder strategy game without a big arsenal of close and long range weapons at your disposal. So, you get baseball bats, guns, bazookas, dynamite, grenades, mines, bouncing balls (and you can make your own, if you can code). Gameplay, sticking to the original theme, is turn based. You have to kill your opponent before he kills you. And the innovation to achieve that is limited only by the limits imposed by your mind. You can play locally against bots or on network to have some cartoony fun with your friends, or to watch your super tux draw first blood of your rivals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Its available for a plethora of platforms including linux, windows, mac and FreeBSD, and the clincher, its F-R-E-E (as in speech as well as in lunch, beer, whatever). You still here? You should have rushed to the Wormux Downloads before I got to the first &amp;ldquo;E&amp;rdquo; of FREE.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Linux: Webcam Fun</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/02/linux-webcam-fun/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Mar 2008 03:30:00 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/03/02/linux-webcam-fun/</guid><description>If you thought that a webcam is just for getting in visual touch with your distant friends, then you could not be more wrong.

&lt;p>I’m going on a week’s vacation with no net connection, hence this sprang to my mind. What if I can “&lt;strong>call&lt;/strong>” my blog? If I can install a VOIP gateway kind of thing on my web server (or maybe use a third party one, like skype?) and give it access to my database. Now, I can just call my blog’s number from any phone in the world and the possibilities are now endless. e.g.:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I could moderate comments through a voice mail like system, the blog can read out the comments to me, using text-to-speech, and I can press buttons, or use IVR to moderate them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I could even call in and “dictate” posts to my blog that can be published. Thus we will be saved from writing a lot of future posts before going on vacations (like I’m doing right now &lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/smile9.gif" alt=""> )&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Can you think of any more uses of this? Or can you think of any other innovative ideas for improving WordPress, or blogging in general? If yes, then let me know. Lets see what ideas those great minds out there can spin out..&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>WordPress Must Have Plugins: Download Managers</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/29/wordpress-must-have-plugins-download-managers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Feb 2008 04:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/29/wordpress-must-have-plugins-download-managers/</guid><description>If you serve any kind of files for download on your WordPress blog(s), one thing you should definitly be looking out for is a download manager plugin.

Post attachments are oh-so-2007. Uploading files to your server and hand-posting links everywhere is a pain in the butt. And what about your hunger for statistics?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, if you agree with me, then i would like to tell you about two fantastic plugins:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://urbangiraffe.com/plugins/drain-hole/">Drain Hole&lt;/a>:&lt;/strong> This is a real time saver. Some of the features are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Automatic scanning of directories to generate downloadable files.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Simple interface to upload files&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Categorized downloads&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>SEO urls (no more of those weird links)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Automatic hotlink protection&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Simple integration with SVN repositories&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Can maintain versions of the files (cool !!)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Download urls can be different from their actual path in your server&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Can even pick files from directories residing out of your www or public_html directory.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Superior download security by assigning permissions based on WordPress user roles.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Template tags allow you to insert any particular file(s) or list of all files or files in particular folder on any post, page, sidebar widget&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Statistics - no. of downloads, IP addresses, referrers, etc&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Can force files like php, html, txt etc to be downloaded rather than displaying in browser&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Pretty, can attach icons to files for displaying, different templates can be used for displaying files&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>and…..AJAX &lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/smile1.gif" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>phew, lemme catch my breath here…you can download it from &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/drain-hole/">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://software.y-zone.net/?page_id=3">WP-Vault&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>: This is the second best plugin I could find in this category. It is not as feature rich as Drain Hole, e.g., it misses SEO URls, hotlink protection, svn integration, versioning, etc, but it does have its own set of interesting features:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>get files from FTP/HTTP directly without downloading to computer first. (a real time saver)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Image galleries from stored images.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Supports WordPress&amp;rsquo; caching mechanism to reduce load on database.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>You can take your own pick out of the two. And yeah, this blog uses Drain Hole, if you must ask.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>One Month Completed....</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/28/one-month-completed/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Feb 2008 04:10:00 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/28/one-month-completed/</guid><description>Today, this blog completes one month of its existence in this world.

The gizmodo poster’s comment is:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>……but HTC&amp;rsquo;s finally released a statement saying that a fix is coming. They say that the &lt;strong>video acceleration &lt;em>will&lt;/em> be supported in the future, and will be included in software upgrades for current devices&lt;/strong>…….&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>I’m still puzzled, after reading and rereading HTC’s (pretty short) statement 10 times over and I can’t find where it is mentioned that they will provide video acceleration for the current devices. My point is that if you don’t read it yourself, then better not release it to your readers, (or atleast refrain from commenting on it improperly, if you must be ahead in the “race”).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Read the statement below (and for actual post on Gizmodo, click &lt;a href="http://gizmodo.com/360514/htc-says-software-fix-is-coming-for-lousy-video-drivers">here&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Some of our top engineers have investigated video performance on our devices and have discovered a fix that they claim will dramatically improve performance for common on-screen tasks like scrolling and the like. Their fix would help most of our recent touch-screen products including the Touch family of devices and TYTN II / Tilt, Mogul / XV6900. The update is in testing and we hope to release it soon. However this fix is not a new video driver to utilize hardware acceleration; it is a software optimization. Video drivers are a much more complicated issue that involves companies and engineers beyond HTC alone. We do not want to lead anyone to believe they should expect these. To explain why we are not releasing video acceleration instead of the optimization I offer you our official statement&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;HTC DOES plan to offer software upgrades that will increase feature functionality, over the air wireless speeds and other enhancements for some of the phones being criticized, but we do not anticipate including any additional support for the video acceleration issues cited in customer complaints. It is important for customers to understand that bringing this functionality to market is not a trivial driver update and requires extensive software development and time. HTC will utilize hardware video acceleration like the ATI Imageon in many upcoming products. Our users have made it clear that they expect our products to offer an improved visual experience, and we have included this feedback into planning and development of future products. To address lingering questions about HTC&amp;rsquo;s current MSM 7xxx devices, it is important to establish that a chipset like an MSM7xxx is a platform with a vast multitude of features that enable a wide range of devices with varied functionality. It is common that devices built on platforms like Qualcomm&amp;rsquo;s will not enable every feature or function. In addition to making sure the required hardware is present, unlocking extended capabilities of chipsets like the MSM 7xxx requires in-depth and time consuming software development, complicated licensing negotiations, potential intellectual property negotiations, added licensing fees, and in the case of devices that are sold through operators, the desire of the operator to include the additional functionality. To make an informed decision about which handset suits them best, consumers should look at the product specification itself instead of using the underlying chipset specifications to define what the product could potentially become.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>== Description ==&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shantz WP Prefix Suffix is a light-weight and easy to use plugin which allows you to add any text and/or HTML/CSS code to your posts and/or pages as prefix (top / beginning), middle and/or suffix (bottom /end). (That includes even any new or old posts and pages and even your feed)
Examples of use cases could be to include your copyright message, advertisements (like adsense, etc), permalinks, your other site links, any other custom messages. This works very fine with ads as you don&amp;rsquo;t have to manipulate your posts or templates to add the ad code, shantz-wp-prefix-suffix will do that for you automatically for all posts and you also get basic controls whether to &amp;ldquo;display&amp;rdquo; the ad or not (on home pages, excerpts, etc).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Features:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Add Prefix to all your posts automatically.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Add Prefix to all your pages automatically.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Add Suffix to all your posts automatically.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Add Suffix to all your pages automatically.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You can control the number of paragraphs/words after which your code/text should be added while using the &amp;ldquo;middle&amp;rdquo; option.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Prefix/Suffix can be plain text, HTML, CSS, PHP, javascript etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Optionally display/not display on home page/excerpts etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Control plugin order for fine control over where your code/text is displayed.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>== Installation ==&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The shantz-wp-prefix-suffix plugin can be installed in following easy steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Unzip &amp;ldquo;shantz-wp-prefix-suffix&amp;rdquo; archive and put all files into your &amp;ldquo;plugins&amp;rdquo; folder (/wp-content/plugins/). It is advisable to create a sub directory into the plugins folder, like /wp-content/plugins/shantz-wp-prefix-suffix/&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Activate the plugin&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Go to Options &amp;gt; Shantz WP Prefix Suffix, adjust your settings and save them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>== Frequently Asked Questions ==&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>= How do I add My copyright message and post permalink so as to protect myself against RSS feed scrapers =
Add the following code to &amp;ldquo;Suffix text box&amp;rdquo; and check the &amp;ldquo;enable php input&amp;rdquo; option (without the &amp;ldquo;pre&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;code&amp;rdquo; tags. I put them there for the wordpress readme parser):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>= How do I use this for Adsense =
You can either paste your javascript code in the text box and ads will appear automatically in your posts. If you use an ad management plugin like adsense-manager then you can paste the code given by that plugin in the text box, so that all your posts/pages will be &amp;ldquo;able&amp;rdquo; to display the code but actual display is controlled by your ad management plugin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>= How to upgrade to a new version =
Use the automatic upgrade option in WordPress or simply overwrite the old files with the new ones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>= How can I contribute to keep the development of this plugin going =
You could add a link to my blog from your site or click on the donate link on the settings screen :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>= My question isn&amp;rsquo;t listed here =
Post a comment here, or contact me through the contact page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>== Screenshots ==&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can see the plugin in action on this site on any post (The links at top of each post, the adsense ads in the middle of the posts and the copyright notice and feed subscription links at the bottom)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is a (proof-of-concept) outlook macro that you can use with an outlook rule to retrieve your files from your home/office PC by sending it a mail with a subject having a predefined special keyword and the body containing the names and paths of the files. The remote PC will then mail you the files on a predefined e-mail ID.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This project came into being after reading &lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/357710/retrieve-any-file-on-your-home-computer-by-email">this post&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> at lifehacker (original post and solution &lt;a href="http://murphymac.com/retrieve-a-remote-file-by-email/">here&lt;/a>). It listed a method to retrieve mails on your home/office PC by sending a &amp;ldquo;magic email&amp;rdquo; to it, but it was only for mac&amp;rsquo;s. Seeing that people wanted it for windows as well, I thought of making something up during lunch time at office.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Usage:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Download the attached zip file (shantz-outlook-remote-file-access.zip) and unzip it. It has a VB module &amp;ldquo;shantz-outlook-remote-file-access.bas&amp;rdquo; (can be opened with any text editor)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Create a new macro in Outlook. Copy the code contained in Module1.bas to the main source file of the macro.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Edit the code to change the e-mail ID to which the files will be e-mailed. Save the macro.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Create a new rule in Outlook. Choose to run the rule when a specific word is found in the subject. e.g. use &amp;ldquo;SendMeMyFiles&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The action part of the rule should be &amp;ldquo;run a script&amp;rdquo;. Here you can choose the macro that you just created from the list shown by Outlook.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Save the rule and you are done.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Now try, sending a mail to the account that your outlook is configured to receive mail for, with the special keyword in the subject and a list of files (with their complete absolute paths on the remote computer) separated by semicolons (&amp;quot;;&amp;quot; without the quotes), and watch magic happen :).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>e.g.: To: &lt;a href="mailto:myemail@email.com">myemail@email.com&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>subject: SendMeMyFiles&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Body: c:\path\of\files\file1;d:\second\path\file2&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>IMPORTANT NOTES:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>For this thing to work, outlook has to be running on the remote PC as this depends on a &amp;ldquo;client-side&amp;rdquo; rule.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>This is just a proof-of-concept as of now, so there is no error handling right now. Plus the e-mail body parsing is finicky and so the e-mail body should not have anything other than the file paths and names. This might change in future if I decide to update it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t use it if your life depends on it. Use it for basic purposes and modify and improve it appropriately before you decide to use it seriously (You may submit your modifications here as well)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It has been tested only on Outlook 2003, but might work on others as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Let me know of any thoughts you may have about this.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Boring Meetings?

Building on a five-year partnership which has seen the successful launch of 10 i-mate™ devices on the Telstra network, Telstra has teamed up with i-mate™ again to release the Ultimate mobile devices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;AHA&amp;rdquo; - So, they are not vaporware after all :) !!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2008/02/android-sdk-m5-rc14-now-available.html">Android SDK m5-rc14 now available&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>*&lt;strong>New user interface&lt;/strong> - As I mentioned when we introduced the m3 version of the Android SDK, we&amp;rsquo;re continuing to refine the UI that&amp;rsquo;s available for Android. m5-rc14 replaces the previous placeholder with a new UI, but as before, work on it is still in-progress.&lt;br>
&lt;em>&lt;strong>Layout animations&lt;/strong> - Developers can now create layout animations for their applications using the capabilities introduced in the android.view.animation package. Check out the LayoutAnimation&lt;/em>.java files in the APIDemos sample code for examples of how this works.&lt;br>
*&lt;strong>Geo-coding&lt;/strong> - android.location.Geocoder enables developers to forward and reverse geo-code (i.e. translate an address into a coordinate and vice-versa), and also search for businesses.&lt;br>
*&lt;strong>New media codecs&lt;/strong> - The MediaPlayer class has added support for the OGG Vorbis, MIDI, XMF, iMelody, RTTL/RTX, and OTA audio file formats.&lt;br>
*&lt;strong>Updated Eclipse plug-in&lt;/strong> - A new version of ADT is available and provides improvements to the Android developer experience. In particular, check out the new Android Manifest editor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;WOW&amp;rdquo; What else can I say?!!&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Shantz WordPress QOTD</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/10/shantz-wordpress-qotd/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Feb 2008 10:22:57 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/10/shantz-wordpress-qotd/</guid><description>Shantz WP QOTD is a plugin to add quotes to your wordpress blog in a few easy clicks.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>== Installation ==&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Shantz-WP-QOTD plugin can be installed in following easy steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Unzip &amp;ldquo;shantz-wp-qotd&amp;rdquo; archive and put all files into your &amp;ldquo;plugins&amp;rdquo; folder (/wp-content/plugins/). It is advisable to create a sub directory into the plugins folder, like /wp-content/plugins/shantz-wp-qotd/&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Activate the plugin&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Go to Options &amp;gt; Shantz WP Quotes, adjust your settings and save them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>For adding and configuring widget to sidebar, go to Presentation &amp;gt; Widgets.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>== Frequently Asked Questions ==&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>= How to add quotes anywhere in the posts/pages? =
Use the tag &lt;code>&amp;lt;!-- shantz-wp-qotd {option} --&amp;gt;&lt;/code> anywhere in your post (without the quotes).
Note:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>{option} (including the braces) has to be replaced by the quote pattern that you want: qotd, qottd or r. qotd is quote of the day, qottd is quote of that day and r is random.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The tag has to be added using the code editor and not the visual editor, otherwise it will replace the &amp;lt;, &amp;gt; with their HTML equivalents.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>= How to use the custom separator/multi-line quotes? =
By default, if you leave the custom separator box blank, the plugin uses a newline character as the separator. However, if you have quotes that have multiple lines, you can change this to a tag of your choice, say [quote]. Now, in your quotes file (or quotes pasted in admin panel options) add this tag at the end of each quote and you are done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>= What is the format for saving quotes? =
In text box in admin page, as well as in the file, the quotes have to be saved as one on each line. Each quote is separate by newline.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>= Where is the file with quotes located =&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the get from file option, a file &amp;ldquo;quotes.txt&amp;rdquo; has to be present in the same directory where shantz-wp-qotd.php is residing. A sample quotes.txt has been given with this plugin (with some quotes from southpark, simpsons, matrix and deus ex)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>= I checked the option &amp;ldquo;exclude pages&amp;rdquo; but my pages are still displaying quotes =
Check your WordPress version. This option is effective only for Version 2.1 and above&lt;/p>
&lt;p>= How to upgrade to a new version =
Simply overwrite the old files with the new ones.&lt;/p>

Now, if you host a wordpress blog, you’d be aware of the fact that for wordpress to be able to upload yor files (images, attachements in post etc) to the server, you have to make the upload directory writable by all. Now, this is a BIG security risk. Some people go to the lengths of CHMOD’ding their upload directory for a short while and after upload, restoring the apt file permissions back. Some upload their files separately through ftp. But Blogjet has a very cool feature. It supports uploading all your non-text content to your webspace not only by using wordpress APIs but also through ftp if wordpress doesn’t have necessary permissions to write files on your server. This saves you a lot of time, that you can then devote on writing the actual post instead of meandering around with the “technicalities”. But many a people have a heart-ache configuring the ftp with Blogjet, although it is quite simple really. This is basically due to conflicting and confusing instructions existing on the ‘net. So, here I present to you step by step, simplest instrutions to configure this. Read on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step1) Launch Blogjet. You will be presented with a login screen (shown below). You can create a new account or choose to edit an existing one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/1_blogjet_login_screen.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/1_blogjet_login_screen_thumb.jpg" alt="1_blogjet_login_screen">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step2) Choose “I have a blog” on the next screen. Press next.(You might not get this screen if you are editing an old account. In that case, skip to Step 3)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/2_blogjet_create_blog.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/2_blogjet_create_blog_thumb.jpg" alt="2_blogjet_create_blog">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step3) In the “Edit connection Settings” dialog, click on “Configure Settings Manually”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/3_blogjet_settings.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/3_blogjet_settings_thumb.jpg" alt="3_blogjet_settings">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step4) In the Connection settings dialog, there are two options for wordpress blogs. “Wordpress” and “Wordpress (Direct Upload)”. Choose “Wordpress”. The direct upload feature is for people whose wordpress installations have necessary permissions to create files on the server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/4_blojget_account_settings.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/4_blojget_account_settings_thumb.jpg" alt="4_blojget_account_settings">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step5) Enter the username and password for your blog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/5_blogjet_username.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/5_blogjet_username_thumb.jpg" alt="5_blogjet_username">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step6) Now, you get the FTP Configuration screen. Check out the image below and then read the instructions for filling up various columns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/6_blogjet_config_ftp.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/6_blogjet_config_ftp_thumb.jpg" alt="6_blogjet_config_ftp">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i) Tick the checkbox which says “Use FTP to upload pictures…..”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ii) FTP Server: ftp address for your server. e.g.: &lt;a href="ftp://ftp.mysite.com/">ftp.mysite.com&lt;/a> .If you don’t know this, then you should contact your webhost support staff to know about this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>iii) Port: Generally ftp port is 21. However, if you are not sure, then ask your webhost support staff to get the exact number.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>iv) Remote Folder: This is the folder where you want to upload your stuff but is relative to the path where your ftp connection lands you. You’ll need to make a manual ftp connection to your ftp server first to check this. Check the examples after next step.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>v) Base URL: This is the complete web path, that wordpress (or any user over the web) will use to access the image.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Examples: If your ftp server address is &lt;a href="ftp://ftp.mysite.com/">ftp.mysite.com&lt;/a>, and your wordpress blog address is &lt;a href="http://blog.mysite.com/">http://blog.mysite.com&lt;/a> . Your file directory structure is something like given below:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>/public_html -&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>/public_html/wordpress&lt;/p>
&lt;p>/another_folder&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you connect to ftp manuall, you land up at “/”, you make a new folder at /public_html/wordpress/uploads, where you are going to upload your files. And your blog address &lt;a href="http://blog.mysite.com/">http://blog.mysite.com&lt;/a> points at /public_html/wordpress/ when you go to it through your web browser, then your field values will be:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remote Folder: /public_html/wordpress/uploads&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Base URL: &lt;a href="http://blog.mysite.com/uploads">http://blog.mysite.com/uploads&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notes: So, basically what you can do is for remote folder, connect to ftp, “cd” to the folder where you want to upload and do “pwd”, this is your remote folder address. For Base url, find out, where your blog address points to (take help of your webhost support if u need), then find your upload folder’s path relative to it, and add that relative path in front of your blog address.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>vi) Username/password: This is your ftp username and password given to you by your webhost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>vii) Now, click on “Test this configuration”. If everything is ok, then you’ll get a “FTP Configured properly” message as shown below. Then click ok and next.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/7_blogjet_ftp_configured.jpg">&lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/7_blogjet_ftp_configured_thumb.jpg" alt="7_blogjet_ftp_configured">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step7) Click on finish. You are done. &lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/smile1.gif" alt="">. Do let me know if this worked for you or you had any issues.&lt;/p>

The feature is that you, the viewer, can reorganize the widgets on the left and right sidebars according to your preference, like move the “Pages” widget towards the top for convenient navigation through all the static pages in the site. All this through simple steps like -“&lt;strong>Click, drag, drop&lt;/strong>” and you are set. The other widgets will automatically move up and down to make space. And the clincher is that it will remember your preferences &lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/smile1.gif" alt=""> (actually the browser will remember, I think). So, whenever you come back to the site, you will see it the way you like it. Here is an example:&lt;/p>

The issue is that for many people viewing wordpress blogs using this theme, the right sidebar doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear on the right, but **below **the middle column main area.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t know this problem existed as I don&amp;rsquo;t use IE but when a friend mailed to let me know, I started hunting around for the solution. Infact, found on the home page of i3theme, that the author acknowledged this bug and fixed it in v1.5, except the fact, that the fix doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. Because this blog was also using the same version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, not taking anything away from the author, who has done a wonderful job with the theme, I took it upon myself to fix it, and the solution turned out to be really simple.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first thing I noticed was the &amp;ldquo;tag cloud&amp;rdquo;. Since many of my posts are tagged &amp;ldquo;Windows Mobile&amp;rdquo;, this particular tag had become pretty big, so much so that it was being cut off by the left sidebar boundary. But when I viewed the site in IE, it showed the full tag, but the last 2 letters were jutting out of the left sidebar. which caused the middle area to shift towards right ever so slightly, nudging the right sidebar towards the bottom in the process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hmm, this was the reason that many people never see this problem because they may have a particularly balanced blog (or with shorter tags) where one particular tag does not go out of the boundaries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The solution as anyone can guess now is to keep that tag within its range. Now, I call my solution as a hack or a workaround because ideally, we should be able to create a method to make the tag &amp;ldquo;word wrap&amp;rdquo; inside the edges. But since I was unable to get this done, I chose a simpler way. Make the tag small enough so that it fits &lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/smile3.gif" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, how are we going to do this. Wordpress uses a template tag called &amp;ldquo;wp_tag_cloud&amp;rdquo; to generate the tag cloud. (Usage: &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, this tag takes, amongst various other parameters, the values for the largest and smallest font size used for the cloud. So, what all we have to do is find the tag and pass the appropriate parameter. So, without further ado, here are the steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Go to the path: &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->/wp-includes/widgets.php.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Search for the function &amp;ldquo;wp_widget_tag_cloud&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>change the call &amp;ldquo;wp_tag_cloud();&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;wp_tag_cloud(&amp;rsquo;largest=17&amp;rsquo;);&amp;rdquo;, without the quotes. You may need to expermient with the number you pass as argument according to your tags.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Now, save the file and reload the blog in any IE window and you are done. (Delete the cache first if you are using a cache plugin).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Let me know if this worked for you.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Project: ShantzTodayChanger (Windows Mobile Tool To Cycle Themes/Wallpapers Automatically)</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/03/project-shantztodaychanger-windows-mobile-tool-to-cycle-themeswallpapers-automatically/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Feb 2008 19:45:07 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/02/03/project-shantztodaychanger-windows-mobile-tool-to-cycle-themeswallpapers-automatically/</guid><description>The newly launched [&amp;ldquo;Projects&amp;rdquo;] section is hereby inaugarated with a Windows Mobile Tool developed by me, called “[ShantzTodayChanger]”.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Intro:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a little tool for your Windows Mobile based phones (Compatible with WM5/WM6 but not WM2003) which will cycle ur today background or theme after a set interval of time. It has a lot of features and options that you can discover by reading the text below. And you can even use this options to achieve something other than changing wallpapers as well but that depends on your imagination. ;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**UPDATE: **I&amp;rsquo;ve released the source code of ShantzTodayChanger since I&amp;rsquo;m not getting much time to work on it. You may download the code from the attached zip file above. I’ll still be available for questions, discussions, explanations etc about it if needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You are free to copy, modify and redistribute it. Only thing that I ask of you are that:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You retain all credits for me and my website in the source code, final product, and other material (readme etc) intact.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Also, please provide a linkback to the original home page of shantztodaychanger if you redistribute it through some other site, otherwise I’ll be happy to host your modified versions here.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You also have to release the modified source code in its entirety.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Download:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Usage: **&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Make a folder on ur device (preferably not on storage card.) and extract all the files (mainly ShantzTodayChanger.exe, TdyChangerCfg.exe, gsgetfile.dll (might not be visible to u depending on ur explorer settings) and Readme.htm) to this folder.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>IMP: Do not rename any files.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run the TdyChangerCfg.exe.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Set options through the dialog that opens and press apply button (Pressing the native WM OK button will discard all your changes)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Options:
i)Choose image type (.gif.jpg.png) or theme(.tsk) to be cycled.
ii)If the input files (images or themes) are not in the folder where exes are kept, then you can check the box (underneath the .gif option) and give the &amp;ldquo;FULL and ABSOLUTE&amp;rdquo; path of where the files are kept. You can either input the path thru keyboard or choose it graphically by pressing the button (&amp;hellip;) next to it.
iii)If you want to run a file after every cycle interval, check the corresponding box and provide the &amp;ldquo;FULL and ABSOLUTE&amp;rdquo; path of the file to be run. You can either input the path thru keyboard or choose it graphically by pressing the button (&amp;hellip;) next to it.
iv) If you want some files to be avoided during cycling, put a file mask. The program will look for this mask to appear anywhere in the name of the files and will avoid it if found. (Wildcards are not supported. Choose time option has to be checked for this to work)
v) Choose the period for which mask option has to be used. If you choose a time period and leave mask as empty, then during that time no cycling will be done. If you want to avoid some files all the time, then time period should be chosen to cover all 24 hrs of the day.
vi)enter the desired interval between cycling of images\themes.
vii)If you choose a period for the mask, another check box (Consider mask period for exe also) will be enabled. Checking this box will mean that the specified exe will be run only if an image\theme is changed during that cycle. If you dont check this, then exe will be run after every cycle even if there is no change in the image\theme.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you want to stop the cycling, press &amp;ldquo;STOP Cycling&amp;rdquo; button.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>**Additional Notes: **&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The GUI for configuration has not been optimized for square screen devices, so you need to make some guesswork and use hardware keyboard for input but the changer program itself will run fine.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Doesnt have to be running constantly. So saves resources when not active.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Survives soft resets as well.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Even takes care of the situation if your phone is off when the time to cycle is reached. Will cycle as soon as ur phone comes back on in this situation.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>**Planned Updates: **
i) Suggestions invited. I have a lot of updates in mind but will incorporate those only which are requested by you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Known Issues: **
i) If the mask option is selected, then in a very particular situation, the app will miss a cycle.
This can be taken care of but not in my priority list because this can be fixed only by rewriting the complete cycling code which is quite a bit. So, will fix it if I get some time from my other projects.
ii) If after maknig the configuration, you see the screen flash for a second at the right times, but the backfround doesn&amp;rsquo;t change, then do this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Go to : Settings&amp;hellip;today&amp;hellip;.appearance&lt;/li>
&lt;li>un-check &amp;ldquo;Use this picture as background&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>start the program using &amp;ldquo;startTodayChanger.lnk&amp;rdquo; or TdyChangerCfg (Apply button)
(Thnx to CWKJ for reporting this bug and fix, and to eric for reminding me about it)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>**End Note: **
Like every software, this one is also bound to have bugs, please report it asap.
Though ShantzTodayChanger does not run continuously but sometimes some apps that close all processes automatically (like SPB backup) might clash in schedule with ShantzTodayChanger and close it when it starts to run. In such a case (which is quite unlikely), the app might not be able to set a notification for next cycle, so if u face this situation, then run the config again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Version History: **&lt;/p>
&lt;p>1.53 - 23-March-08 -&amp;gt; RECOMMENDED UPDATE
i)Theme Color Detection has been improved a lot. Should work much more accurately now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>1.52 - 11-Aug-07 -&amp;gt;
i) Fixed another bug for the &amp;ldquo;time period&amp;rdquo; option.
ii) Made a little optimization in the code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>1.51 - 05-Aug-07 -&amp;gt;
i) Fixed a bug which prevented the &amp;ldquo;time period&amp;rdquo; option from working properly.
ii) Fixed a bug where wallpapers might not change if certain particular themes were installed before change cycle happens
iii) Fixed a bug where the time period option was not remembered properly by the GUI.
iv) Added option to allow user to choose whether to run the user specified file (exe\lnk) after every cycle interval only if there was a change in image\theme during that cycle.
v) Made a few small changes to the GUI to prevent users from making incorrect settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>1.50 - 29-July-07 -&amp;gt;MAJOR UPDATE
i) Added option to specify a mask to avoid files having that mask
ii) Added option to specify the time period during which the mask has to be considered
iii) Added code to ensure that if mask is empty and a period is chosen, then no rotation is done during that period.
iv) Added option to run a user specified file after every cycle interval.
v) Fixed bug where the jpg and png options were not working earlier.
vi) Clicking help button now opens help in Pocket Internet Explorer.

&lt;p>As the pic above says, it turned out to be quite elementary in the end. But what is &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rdquo; actually?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Problem:&lt;/strong> Since the beginning of time (read launching of WM6), millions of WM users (ok ok, will not exaggerate from now on) have been facing a very peculiar issue. The issue is that people tell them all the time that they are avoiding those people, and not taking their calls. But as the perplexed WM&amp;rsquo;er flips through his calls log, he can&amp;rsquo;t find any sign of a missed call. Yes, the issue is that many times, the phone will go into a state where the caller will hear the ring go, there will be no sign on your phone of the same, not even a missed call. People all around the world have been after the solution with all their might, suggesting:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>To change over to Radio Rom x.xx.xx and swear it solved all their issues but we have had equal number of people in both camps (fixed and non-fixed) for every radio rom.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Various kinds of flashing techniques and orders but no concrete solution here either.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Standing on their heads and chanting &amp;ldquo;OM&amp;rdquo; for 10000 years (I&amp;rsquo;m at it again &lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/smile3.gif" alt=""> )&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Anyways, the long and short of it is, they didn&amp;rsquo;t get anywhere. But worry no more, the messiah is here to save you all from social embarrassment. Click on Continue reading to find the solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>**What To Expect: **This will fix the missing call issue, plus on the phones I tested, the following issues were also fixed:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>* Signal strength meter remains stuck at whatever the strength was when the phone was booted.
* The phone LCD turns on for no reason sometime.
* I personally found the signal quality to be better. Previously I wasn't able to take/make any calls in my office cubicle but now I can.
* A solution so simple, obvious and the fact that you already know it. ![](/img/uploads/smile3.gif)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Disclaimer:&lt;/strong> Though I&amp;rsquo;ve promised you almost everything (except the kitchen sink), and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure that this should work for you (as I&amp;rsquo;ve tested this on three different HTC wizards, running different variations of WM6 ROMS), but still YMMV. (Just to save my skin from a disgruntled user who didn&amp;rsquo;t get it fixed and turned into a blood sucking psychopath, or even worse, a lawsuit-happy Jeff Thomson).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another thing to be noted is that if you use ActiveSync to sync with an exchange server, you&amp;rsquo;d probably not be able to solve your problems. Read on to find about it [Thnx to Alex, vboyz103 for reminding me to put it here]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Reasoning:&lt;/strong> Let me take you through my journey of discovering the solution to the problem. There are a lot of events that happened, many things I saw that led me to the solution:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Once I saw my phone light up for no reason and then after a few seconds I received a call on my landline saying I was not picking up my phone. I then tried calling up my phone again and again, every time I didn&amp;rsquo;t get any notification on my phone &amp;ldquo;except&amp;rdquo; a momentary flash up.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Another day I was tapping away at my keyboard, with my phone nearby. Then suddenly again there was a flash up, no call notification, BUT my speakers started humming, for a long time, i.e., as if in a call and not due to those momentary SDCCH transmissions. This meant that the radio ROM was indeed receiving the call, but somehow it could not notify the OS to tell me. &lt;em>Something was breaking the notification mechanism.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>All times this happened, and I came to know, I checked to know what all tasks were running and somehow Active Sync was always there.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I tried killing active sync and then calling. Active Sync would be there again. But if I kill it and dont call, then it won&amp;rsquo;t be there. &lt;em>Hmmm..&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I had heard that switching off and flight mode solves this issue temporarily. I tried it. Flight mode could be switched on but was not able to switch off. That is my phone didn&amp;rsquo;t come back, &lt;strong>until&lt;/strong> I tried killing active sync and voila, phone could be turned on again.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>**The Solution: **Now, I was pretty sure that it had something to do with Active Sync. Another thing was I never had the missing calls issue, until this december when I switched to a new ROM. Was the new ROM bad? Couldn&amp;rsquo;t be because people had reported issues on earlier ROMs as well which I had used but never faced the problem. Then it suddenly dawned on me in zen-like-fashion. The legendary &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>Fake Server Trick&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;. In all my flashes, it was part of my initial rituals to do (along with the customary sacrificial goat) this but this time I had forgotten to. I immediately did it and when I reached the Active Sync schedule settings it was selected to &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>As Items Arrive&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;. Voila! I did the trick at a time when I was missing calls and immediately saw the results. Called from another phone and I got a ring &lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/smile1.gif" alt="">. Somehow, it was eating up the notifications thinking they are some &amp;ldquo;items&amp;rdquo; meant for it. Since then, I tried it out on two more phones of friends with different WM6 ROMs and they havent seen the problem ever since, plus they got all the other benefits too as listed in &amp;ldquo;What to Expect&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**The Trick: **Most of you who came here must be knowing the fake server trick, but if you don&amp;rsquo;t, then here it is:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Turn on your Device&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Go to Start &amp;gt; Programs &amp;gt; Activesync.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Tap Menu at the bottom right hand corner of the screen.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Tap on Add Server Source.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Enter anything in all the boxes. Don&amp;rsquo;t need to go to any advanced options, etc. e.g. you can add &amp;ldquo;fake&amp;rdquo; in all options&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Go back into the Menu, and tap &amp;ldquo;Schedule&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Change both the Peak times and Off-peak times boxes to Manually.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Press the OK button at top-right.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You are done.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note:&lt;/strong> If you face any sync errors after doing this trick, then delete the config you just made for exchange and then try. Basically once you have done the schedule setting, you don&amp;rsquo;t require the exchange config anymore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Epilogue:&lt;/strong> Now, this has been working for me and my friends for the past few days. I deliberately delayed this post to be exactly sure. You are welcome to give me a simple thanks if it works for you. BUT if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t then also please let me know, may be we can debug it together.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>WM6.1 Is Here, Loves HTC Wizard...(Really?)</title><link>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/01/31/wm61-is-here-loves-htc-wizardreally/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jan 2008 05:54:42 +0000</pubDate><author>shantanu@shantanugoel.com (Shantanu Goel)</author><guid>https://shantanugoel.com/2008/01/31/wm61-is-here-loves-htc-wizardreally/</guid><description>A user going by the remarkably simple handle &amp;ldquo;email123&amp;rdquo; announced on the xda-developers forum, that WM6.1 is here, alive and kicking.

&lt;p>In fact, the current crop of Linux based blog clients is at best childish, compared to these. A piece of software called &lt;a href="http://www.larryborsato.com/bleezer/">Bleezer&lt;/a> did offer a good set of features and supported linux as well, but turned out it was so crash-y, hogged up enormous amounts of ram, and had other issues that come usually packed with all java apps. But I wasn’t gonna boot into WinDUHs, just for one sole software, was I?? Sure, I wasn’t &lt;img src="https://shantanugoel.com/img/uploads/smile1.gif" alt="">. I tried the usual routine of trying to run them through wine but it wasn’t supported. I resorted to my faithful ol’ google, and chanced across &lt;a href="http://www.thetechandcents.com/2007/11/running-zoundry-blog-editor-under-wine.html">this little nugget&lt;/a>, with step by step instructions to achieve my goal. And it had a bonus. It told me about &lt;a href="http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/page/Main_Page">IEs4Linux&lt;/a> (IE’s For Linux). yes, you read correctly. You can run Internet Explorer on your Linux box as well. All this in under 10 minutes (Ubuntu wins again).

A google search is going to even confuse you further. As you wade into this enormous ocean, you will be wowed by the offers given by some of these hosts, throwing away 100&amp;rsquo;s of GBs (no less) of disk space and bandwidth running into terrabytes. Almost every software on earth in your one-click fantastico arsenal. (plus they promise to do your dishes after you are through with the dinner too). All this and more for a measly 3.99, 4.99, 5.99 and such price. Your jaw already touching the floor, you make a quick dash for your wallet, flip out your credit card, and sign up for that &amp;ldquo;limited time&amp;rdquo; offer for unlimited webspace before it expires. You then laugh at your friend who got a measly 100mb for the same price. But, what gives? Even a 100 GB hdd costs me close to 40-50 bucks, then how come they are able to do it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is no great Indian rope trick around it. The answer lies in just one term &amp;ldquo;oversell&amp;rdquo;. Yes, they oversell their available disk space and bandwidth to the tunes of 10s to 1000s of times, knowing that an average user will never use it up. Even if you do, then your account will be mysteriously suspended for &amp;ldquo;violating the AUP&amp;rdquo;. The AUP practically bans you from doing anything. It is a blend of the most hideous legal jargon signing on which might be equal to bequething all your savings to the host and you will never even come to know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, this post is just meant to be a word of caution for you to stay away from all those big and small names, purportedly touted as the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; on gazillions of sites across the web, and think again. If its too good to be true, it probably is.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For the very post of this blog, I chose a subject that&amp;rsquo;s close to my heart. Yes, its Windows Mobile. My trusted 900/1800 MHZ companion for the past couple of years is an HTC Wizard. If you have ever looked into the WinMob world, its pretty much common knowledge that HTC owns the 95% of market share of this niche little space. They are a huge organization and with huge profits and they do make jolly good phones. BUT it is not the quality of phones that helped them reach this height. Its their business plan. &amp;ldquo;Always keep the customers craving more&amp;rdquo; seems to be the motto of this taiwanese giant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each phone seems to give one extra &amp;ldquo;feature&amp;rdquo; (read UI enhancement) over the latter. With Kaiser, it seemed too good to be true, getting a one in all phone. And it indeed was. As I pointed out &lt;a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=1767873&amp;amp;postcount=389">here&lt;/a> , it finally turned into a reality against all hopes of fellow WinMo owners, and HTC &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/01/25/htc-further-responds-to-video-driver-issue-will-improve-future/">declared&lt;/a> that nothing is coming for the current crop.
